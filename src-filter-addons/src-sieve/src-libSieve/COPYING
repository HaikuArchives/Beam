The bulk of code in this distribution is covered by an simple license from CMU.
Some other parts of code are covered by an "advertising" license. Those parts
will be replaced over time to create a non-advertised version of libSieve.

New portions of code are copyrighted by the libSieve team, and contributions
are assumed to have thier copyrights assigned to the libSieve team unless
specifically stated otherwise. At this time, the 'libSieve team' is defined
to be persons with CVS commit rights to the libSieve source code repository.

Licensing for this libSieve distribution is currently held to be the union of
the two licenses below, minus item 4 of the latter license, and with all
references to CMU (in short or written out) replaced by 'The libSieve Team.'

In the future, a more rigorous license may be adopted to apply to that and any
later versions. Such a change would not be retroactive to this version at all.
It should be understood that such a change is not in violation of the CMU
licensing; to boil compliance with CMU terms to a nutshell:

1. CMU has no fault for anything this software does or is used to do.
2. The terms may not be removed from the source files unless all original CMU
   code is also removed or replaced from said files.
3. The distribution must include the advertising clause so long as any CMU
   code contained in affected source files is not replaced or removed.

Other than those three conditions, new licensing terms may be applied by the
maintainers of this particular distribution and compilation of code.

This is the simpler CMU license:
