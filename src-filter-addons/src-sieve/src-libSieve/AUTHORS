  Aaron Stone <aaron@serendipity.cx> broke the mold and made libSieve into
  its own distribution with some API changes for easier integration.

  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi> submitted fixes for potential buffer overflows.
  
  Oliver Tappe <zooey@hirschkaefer.de> submitted fixes for BeOS builds.

Their work builds upon these fine fellows' work at CMU:

  Larry Greenfield <leg+sieve@andrew.cmu.edu> wrote the first pass.

  Alexy Melnikov <mel@taxxi.com> submitted some bug fixes and improvements.

  Ken Murchison <ken@oceana.com> took the ball, added more extensions
  than existed in the known world, and overall improved the code mightily.
