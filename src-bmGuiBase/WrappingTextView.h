//*** DESCRIPTION ***
//WrappingTextView class

//Extends BTextView functionality somewhat.  Automates setting up the TextRect and updating it during resizing
//so that re-wrapping is live.  Also provides a StoreChanges hook function that is called when the WrappingTextView
//loses focus or is removed from the window or destroyed.  This is useful if the view is of an object that can
//exist without the view, so that this more persistent object can be kept up-to-date when the text is modified,
//without having to update the other object every time a character is entered.
