//please contact me to negotiate a fee for use. After all, I did work hard on this class and invested a lot
//of time into it. That being said, DON'T WORRY I don't want much. It totally depends on the sort of project
//you're working on and how much you expect to make off it. If someone makes money off my work, I'd like to
//get at least a little something.  If any of the components of Santa's Gift Bag are is used in a shareware

//can take advantage of enhancements and bug fixes as they become available. Feel free to distribute the 
//ColumnListView source, including modified versions, but keep this documentation and license with it.

//*** DESCRIPTION ***
//If you have a BScrollView with horizontal and vertical sliders that isn't 
//seated to the lower-right corner of a B_DOCUMENT_WINDOW, there's a "hole"
//between the sliders that needs to be filled.  You can use this to fill it.
//In general, it looks best to set the ScrollViewCorner color to 
//BeInactiveControlGrey if the vertical BScrollBar is inactive, and the color
//to BeBackgroundGrey if the vertical BScrollBar is active.  Have a look at
//Demo3 of ColumnListView to see what I mean if this is unclear.
