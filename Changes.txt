change-history of Beam:
		$Id$

[Beam v0.913, 2002-11-15]:
	all:
		-	added a +1 to many BString::LockBuffer() calls in order to have enough
			room for the trailing '\0'. The BeBook isn't too clear about this, so we 
			play safe.
			
	BmApp:
		-	replaced old, overly simple deskbar-item with new implementation
		-	in QuitRequested() we now find out if there is any window that does 
			not want to quit yet. Only if there's no veto, we go on and really quit
			all windows and the app.
	
	BmBodyPartList:
		-	added functionality to automatically determine the correct mimetype
			of any attachment during open/save, if that mimetype has no or an
			incorrect mimetype set.
		-	now Beam no longer complains about empty multipart bodies, where the
			boundary appears only once (with appended '--')
	
	BmBodyPartView:
		-	now verifies advertised mimetype before opening an attachment
	
	BmDataModel:
		-	added HandleError(), which knows when to log and/or show errors
	
	BmDeskbarView:
		-	added implementation of a real deskbar-view that does not seem to crash
			the original R5-deskbar anymore
	
	BmEncoding:
		-	fixed bug introduced in 0.913rc2 that would incorrectly handle softbreaks
			that were followed by only a single character. This resulted in newlines being 
			removed were they shouldn't and the mail-layout being somewhat garbled.
			N.B.: This bug affected only the displaying of mails, not the actual mail
			generation.
		-	fixed bug with quoted-printable encoding that would let an underscore-char
			pass through unencoded (which would lead to erraneous results in the 
			decoding stage, in turn messing up iso-2022-jp encodings, which in turn
			would cut off messages!).
	
	BmJobStatusWin:
		-	changed filter-hack to start immediately after all popper-jobs have finished,
			not after they have been removed from the status-win.
	
	BmListController:
		-	enhanced "spring-loaded"-opening of folders in such a way that the 
			timer-triggered expand/collapse would not occur when the user has
			expanded/collapsed the current item manually (by moving the mouse 
			over the expander).
	
	BmLogHandler:
		-	now we are logging proper timestamps (with msecs)
		-	BM_LOGERR now always logs into current logfile, too
		
	BmMail:
		-	a race-condition that occurs when multiple mails are being deleted through
			the trash would sometimes lead to the strange effect that the mail-ref would
			select and try to display a message that has just been deleted. In this case
			an error message was shown that complained about the deleted message
			not being there >:o/ Now we simply do not display such a message but
			ignore a missing message quietly.
		-	when creating a reply, the algorithm by which we determine the receiving
			address (the new from) has been improved to handle gracefully the case
			where the account that has received the mail could not be found anymore
			(for instance because it has been renamed).
		-	corrected handling of multiple originators when generating reply-/forward-intro.
		-	set default from-account when redirecting mails
	
	BmMailFolder:
		-	fixed bug in AddMailRef() & RemoveMailRef() where the methods would
			return without handling the needed new-mail status-changes.
	
	BmMailView:
		-	added missing conversion to local linebreaks for mimeparts that
			make use of the 'binary' content-transfer-encoding.
		-	added support for copying URLs to clipboard
	
	BmPopper:
		-	from now on, errors are shown only when ShouldContinue() yields true
	
	BmPrefs...View:
		-	changed minimum sizes to cooperate with 800*600 screens
		
	BmResources:
		-	added sanity-check to FetchOwnFQDN() that removes any newlines 
			from hostname/domain.
			
	BmSmtp:
		-	from now on, errors are shown only when ShouldContinue() yields true
	
	BmUtil:
		-	fixed buffer-overflow in ConvertTabsToSpaces() that caused many crashes.
		-	now WordWrap() works correctly even if the to-be-wrapped text doesn't
			end with a newline
		-	removed call to LockBuffer( 0) that doesn't work under Dano
	
	ColumnListView:
		-	added a workaround for the problem with the BListView not correctly
			scrolling down with the selection when the user uses Shift-CursorDown
			to extend the selection beyond the visible items.
		-	pressing escape now deselects all items. This way it is possible to get
			out of the all-items-are-selected trap (cursor would not move anymore).
	
	PCRE:
		-	updated to pcre v3.9


[Beam v0.913rc2, 2002-06-14]:
	BmBodyPartList:
		-	fixed crashing bug when saving non-text attachments
		-	now transfer-encodings like '8bits' are handled correctly (as '8bit')
	
	BmEncoding
		-	qp-lines ending with an *encoded* '=' were incorrectly joined with
			the following line (only plain [non-encoded] '=' indicate a soft-wrap).
		
	BmJobStatusWin:
		-	a PopperView now only beeps once when new mail has arrived
		-	when a complete Popper-run is done, Beam looks for an executable
			named 'filter' in the app's home folder, which is then executed. 
			This way, external mail filtering can be done.
	
	BmListViewController:
		-	added support for delayed auto-expand/-collapse during drag
		-	fixed leaking of all items in destructor...this additionally closes
			the reference leaks that showed when closing prefs-window
	
	BmMailEditWin:
		-	fixed bug that caused unmodified mails to not be hard-wrapped
			before send
		-	if there's only one smtp-account, it is selected automatically
	
	BmMailFolderView
		-	pressing the right control-key while moving the mouse-wheel or using the 
			cursor-keys will scroll the mail-view (only left key was working before)
	
	BmMailRefView:
		-	fixed ref-leak when handling a drop
		-	pressing the right control-key while moving the mouse-wheel or using the 
			cursor-keys will scroll the mail-view (only left key was working before)
		
	BmMailView:
		-	when pasting text, now the font of the mailview is forced upon the
			pasted text
		-	signatures with special characters are now displayed correctly 
			(superfluous conversion to UTF8 removed).
		-	when the user has selected a new signature, the cursor is now positioned
			immediately *before* the new sig-text (not at the end of the sig, as before).
		-	pressing the right control-key while moving the mouse-wheel or using the 
			cursor-keys will scroll the mailref-view (only left key was working before)
	
	BmMainWindow:
		-	removed ref-leak in BmMainMenuBar, which occurred whenever any 
			pop-account was added/removed/changed.
		-	fixed problem with BmMainMenuBar not showing any Pop-Accounts at all.
			
	WrappingTextView:
		-	fixed bug when undoing a deletion (now the deleted text is saved
			*before* it is being deleted from textview, err...)

[Beam v0.913rc1, 2002-05-09]:

	base64:
		-	added (code comes straight from MDR). This code replaces the one
			supplied by BeOS that crashes upon encountering incorrect data.

	Beam_release.proj:
		-	added -no-fpic -fomit-frame-pointer parameters for better code
	
	Beam...bone.proj
		-	added separate project-files for bone-/dano-version.
	
	BmApp:
		-	joined replies/forwards now correctly generate subjects through 
			BmMail::CreateXXXSubjectFor()-methods.
			Additionally, now the first subject gets copied into the joined mail
			plus a ' (and more...)', indicating that there's more than one subject.
		-	added support for subjects and URL-encodings in mailto: URLs
		-	when marking mails as read that are not new (replied, forwarded, etc.)
			Beam now asks the user whether to just mark new mails or really
			mark all.
		-	fixed reference-leak when printing mails
		-	fixed crash in RefsReceived when a non-mail reference has been received
		
	BmBodyPartList:
		-	Erraneous MIME-headers with missing semicolon between field-value and 
			attributes no longer cause an exception (they are now silently accepted).
	
	BmBodyPartView:
		-	fixed bug with icons being cut off down the tree hierarchy
	
	BmDataModel:
		-	BmListModel now sets and updates a mNeedsStore-flag as needed (this
			flag indicates that the list has changed and should be stored)
		
	BmEncoding:
		-	replaced BeOS-native base64-routines by the ones from MDR (which do not
			seem to crash).
	
	BmJobStatusWin:
		-	removed Window()->UpdateIfNeeded()-call in BmPopperView::AskUserForPwd(),
			since that's potentially unsafe and is not needed anyway.
		-	improved look'n'feel of password-acquisitors
		-	added support for beep-event when new mail arrived.
		-	fixed problem with auto-checks removing job-window when they
			should not.
	
	BmMail:
		-	fixed bug in AddPartsFromMail which always added forward-intro, even
			if current mail was a reply.
		-	filename-creation now respects B_FILE_NAME_LENGTH
		-	when creating reply-/forward-intro, %s now expands to subject and
			\n to newline.
		-	quoting now handles non-trivial encodings better (like iso-2022-jp), now
			the character-count is used instead of the byte-count.
		-	saving a message does not re-read it from disk anymore, since this does
			not make sense anymore (not that it used to make much sense before...)
		
	BmMailEditWin:
		-	hardwrapping is only executed directly before a mail is sent (not when
			it is saved as draft).
		-	now the mail-date is bumped whenever the mail is saved (per default)
		
	BmMailFolderView:
		-	now allows scrolling of refview by SHIFT-modifier and scrolling of mailview
			by CONTROL-modifier
	
	BmMailRefList:
		-	now the mailref-cache is only stored when neccessary
		-	changed structure of mail-cache for better performance when reading/
			writing the cache.
	
	BmMailView:
		-	mouse-cursor changes if hovering over URL
		-	fixed BTextView-issue when typing spaces at end of line, now only
			one space is accepted.
		-	the TextRect is now recalculated when the font changes
		-	added multi-level undo (limited only by available memory)
			
	BmPopAccount:
		-	when re-reading POP-account-settings within prefs, the state of downloaded
			messages must be kept as is (not re-read), since otherwise Beam may
			download messages again that already were downloaded before.
		
	BmPrefs:
		-	now all public calls are secured by a locker, since when resetting prefs to
			saved state, we might be causing crashes without the lock.
	
	BmPrefsGeneralView:
		-	checkbox added for new-mail beep-event (on/off)
	
	BmPrefsMailReadView:
		-	fixed non-working AutoCheckOnlyIfPPPRunning-checkbox
		-	fixed non-working MarkAsReadDelay-control.
		
	BmPrefsRecvMailView:
		-	added sanity-check
	
	BmPrefsSendMailView:
		-	fixed state-handling (enabling/disabling) properly
		-	added sanity-check
	
	BmSignature:
		-	dynamic signatures are now interpreted as a shell-script, not as one
			single command
	
	WrappingTextView:
		-	when removing characters (e.g. by pressing Delete), a modification-msg
			now indicates the state change

v0.912, 2002-04-14
	-	better support for forwarding & replying to multiple messages at once,
		now you can choose whether or not to join the messages.
	-	added support for printing one or more messages.
	-	corrected some MIME-problems, increasing robustness and eliminating 
		the compatibility-problems Beam had with other mail-programs 
		(like Mail-It or Eudora). These programs now accept Beam-generated 
		MIME-messages, including quoted-printables and attachments.
	-	doubleclicking a folder now opens the corresponding Tracker-window.
	-	deactivating the Desktop-icon does work now.
	-	added configurable delay before a shown mail is being marked as read.
	-	added option for using 8-bit-mime when constructing mails.
	-	added an option to switch between soft/hard-wrapping of the mailtext 
		(Beam always used soft-wrapping before).
	-	when requested, Beam can now contact a POP3/SMTP-server and suggest 
		the best (most "secure") authentication type.
	-	and other (minor) bugfixes, usability and GUI-enhancements.

v0.911, 2002-03-24
	-	fixed stupid bug that caused Beam to crash if no FolderView-state
		exists (like after first install)
	-	forwarding attachments works correctly now

v0.91, 2002-03-24
	-	header-view contents are now selectable and draggable.
	-	added support for redirecting mails.
	-	Beam now works under Dano (BeOS 5.1).
	-	signature support added (for static and dynamic signatures).
	-	added automatic mail-checking (every xx minutes).
	-	all shortcuts are now configurable via prefs.
	-	added better quoting-modes (simple, push-margin and auto-wrap)
		in order to reduce comb-like effect.
	-	added option to show in- & out-folders always at top.
	-	added tooltips to all preferences-controls, which is one step
		on the way to better usability (but Online-Help still missing).
	-	added Deskbar icon indicating the presence of new mail.
		(This seems to constantly crash the R5 Deskbar, but it works
		for OpenTracker & Dano versions...)
	-	Display-font can now be selected when viewing/editing mails.
	-	Beam can now set itself up as preferred email application.
	-	fixed problems with node-monitoring stopping to work after a
		recreate-cache.
	-	Beam now correctly shows BeOS standard-icons for mails, if 
		Beam is preferred app.
	-	fixed incorrect mail-address creation in case of phrases containing
		commas (like: Meyer, Justin <xx@yyy.zz>). This would now be created
		as "Meyer, Justin" <xx@yyy.zz>.
	-	fixed problems with highlighting URLs that contain a tilde ('~').
	-	many more bugfixes

v0.903, 2002-02-22
	-	Beam no longer complains about unknown prefs-field 'BeMailStyle'.

v0.902, 2002-02-22
	-	removed crashing bug when wildly moving through mailfolder-view.
	-	disabled selecting and invoking for	the dummy-mailrefview used in prefs.
	-	make the reply-mode with selected text work (only selected text will be
		included in reply).

v0.901, 2002-02-21
	-	enable people to send mail if there is no working name-service
		(Beam used to complain that it could not determine own hostname).
		In this case, Beam now uses host/domain info from network settings-file.
													[thx to the many people who reported this]
	-	preferences window is now moved to front when a user tries to open it twice
		(instead of crashing, as before).
	-	recreating a mailfolder-cache now works.
	-	new prefs-flag that selects BeMail-compatible shortcuts.
	-	when a new node has been detected and seems to have zero size, we assume
		that an application is creating the mail-file directly inside the in-folder.
		In this case, we snooze for a short amount of time and then proceed to
		read the file, which hopefully is now completely written.
		This is no complete solution, but I hope that this will increase 
		compatibility with MailDaemonReplacement and other programs.
	-	fixed a couple of smaller redraw/layout issues

v0.90, 2002-02-19
	- first public release
