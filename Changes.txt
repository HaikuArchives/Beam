change-history of Beam:
		$Id$

v0.902, 2002-02-22
	-	removed crashing bug when wildly moving through mailfolder-view.
	-	disabled selecting and invoking for	the dummy-mailrefview used in prefs.
	-	make the reply-mode with selected text work (only selected text will be
		included in reply).
Thanks for bugreports & suggestions:
	Charlie Clark

v0.901, 2002-02-21
	-	enable people to send mail if there is no working name-service
		(Beam used to complain that it could not determine own hostname).
		In this case, Beam now uses host/domain info from network settings-file.
													[thx to the many people who reported this]
	-	preferences window is now moved to front when a user tries to open it twice
		(instead of crashing, as before).
	-	recreating a mailfolder-cache now works.
	-	new prefs-flag that selects BeMail-compatible shortcuts.
	-	when a new node has been detected and seems to have zero size, we assume
		that an application is creating the mail-file directly inside the in-folder.
		In this case, we snooze for a short amount of time and then proceed to
		read the file, which hopefully is now completely written.
		This is no complete solution, but I hope that this will increase 
		compatibility with MailDaemonReplacement and other programs.
	-	fixed a couple of smaller redraw/layout issues
