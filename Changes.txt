change-history of Beam:
		$Id$



< 2005-08-19: commit, moved tag 'current-devel', release test-050819 >

BmMainWindow:
	-	temporarily removed 'Find Messages'-menu as it ain't working anyway.

< 2005-08-18: commit >

BmPrefsGeneralView:
	-	circumvent what seems to be a bug in BFilePanel, which deadlocks the
		app when using SetPanelDirectory() on an existing (sic!) dir.

< 2005-08-17: commit >

BuildSettings:
	-	now uses -mcpu=pentiumpro instead of -march=pentiumpro such that Beam
		is still able to run on non-pentiumpro CPUs (like VIA C3).

< 2005-08-10: commit >

BmPrefs:
	-	switched to attribute-based storage
	-	default-settings are now blended into the existing settings.

BmSieveFilter:
	-	added support for relational operators to GUI.

several files:
	-	fixed some prefs-related glitches and typos.

< 2005-08-08: commit >

BmBodyPartList:
	-	fixed unsafe filename handling when trying to store an attachment.

BmCaption, BmMailView, BmMainWindow:
	-	activating the incremental search now visually changes the caption-view
		such that the user has a better chance of understanding what's going
		on. Idea (and color >:o) from Stippi.

BmMailViewWin:
	-	fixed crashing bug in CreateGUI().
	-	find-request is now passed on to mail-view.

< 2005-08-08: commit >
 
BmMailHeaderView:
	-	adapted to new signature of TimeToSwatchString().

BmMailRef:
	-	now uses modification-time instead of creation-time when initializing
		the when-created attribute, as this gives better results for mail files
		that have been copied between partitions (the creation-time then holds
		the time of the copy, while the mod-time holds the time the mail had
		been written).
	-	mWhenCreatedString and mWhenString have been moved out of the model
		into the view, as the view now selects the date-format depending on
		the available column space.

BmMailRefView:
	-	Date-columns are now automatically reformatted such that they fit into
		the available column space (if at all possible). Idea from Stippi.

CLVEasyItem:
	-	added ColumnFitsText() which determines whether or not a given text
		fits into a column.
	-	improved const-correctness somewhat.

BmUtil:
	-	changed TimeToSwatchString() such that it accepts other formats, too.

< 2005-08-07: commit >

many files:
	-	reworked visuals and some parts of behaviour such that Beam now works
		and looks properly on R5 and Zeta.

< 2005-07-28: commit >

BeamApp:
	-	avoid sending of pendings mails if check has been triggered automatically,
		as I consider this behaviour confusing.

BmBodyPartList:
	-	fixed crash when adding an empty attachment.

BmBodyPartView:
	-	improved drag'n'drop handling such that we can now accept a drop from
		BeMail. However, BeMail doesn't accept drops from us, but that seems
		to be a problem over there, as BeMail requires drag messages to contain
		a ref (but we don't since the attachment is yet a virtual file).

many files:
	-	changed HandleDrop() to take a non-const BMessage*, as sending a reply
		doesn't work on const BMessages.

UserResizeSplitView:
	-	changed drawing to match Stippi's style used in Wonderbrush.

< 2005-07-24: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BeamApp:
	-	in RefsReceived(), we now support people-files too. A new mail will
		be created with the given people as recipients (idea taken from Zeta).
	-	depending on prefs-value 'SendPendingMailsOnCheck', we now send all
		pending mails on a mail-check (again, idea taken from Zeta).

BmBodyPartView:
	-	now uses BRoster::Launch(type, argc, argv) instead of Launch(eref),
		as the latter doesn't work for firefox (idea taken from Zeta).

BmMailEditWin:
	-	reworked handling of people-drops in order to simplify handling
		of people files in app's RefsReceived().

BmPeople:
	-	added support for fetching all emails from a given people file ref.

BmPrefs:
	-	added 'SendPendingMailsOnCheck'.

BuildSettings:
	-	now uses 'pentiumpro' architecture on x86.

< 2005-07-03: commit >

BmMenuControl:
	-	fixed layouting code such that the vertical size and position always
		match the ones used by a BmTextControl that has a menu as its label.

BmPrefsFilterView:
	-	fixed min height being too small for 13pt font.

BmTextControl:
	-	minor cleanup.

< 2005-07-01: commit >

BmListControllerView, BmMailFolderView, BmMailRefView:
	-	implemented hierarchical state-info handling, such that a folder inherits
		the state-info from its parent, but can (explicitly) disconnect from it.
		This should make setting up the preferred listview layout much easier.
	-	The default ref-list layout is now much simpler (lots of columns have
		been hidden).

BmMailEditWin:
	-	fixed bug with signature not automatically being applied to mail when
		a new identity is selected.

BmMailFolder:
	-	now stores info about if the corresponding ref-list's layout is connected
		to parent or not.

BmMailHeader:
	-	fixed bug with 'Name'-attribute not being set for outbound mails.

BmMailViewWin:
	-	added RefListView, such that navigation is possible and independent
		of main window. The RefListView is hidden by default, but can be shown
		by means dragging the split-view at the top downwards.

BmPrefs:
	-	added default shortcuts for the two new menu-cmds 'Previous Message' &
		'Next Message'.

BmWindow:
	-	added message filter for scrollwheel events, which redirects these events
		to the view that currently is under the mouse (suggested by Stephan Aßmus).

ColumnListView:
	-	fixed drawing artefacts when dragging a window across the view (single-
		line updates were not handled correctly).

UserResizeSplitView (and several other files):
	-	added support for auto-hiding a child if the available space is smaller
		than the child's minimum size.

< 2005-05-30: commit >

BmSpamFilter:
	-	oops: the three different instances (classify, learn-as-spam and 
	   learn-as-tofu) all had their own dataset, but only the classify-dataset
	   was actually changed by prefs. Now there's only one (static) dataset left.

< 2005-05-20: commit >

BmToolbarButton:
	-	fixed broken support for toolbar backgrounds, which didn't work properly
		for images that need a certain tile size in horizontal direction.

< 2005-05-18: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmBodyPartList, BmBodyPartView, BmEncoding, BmMailView:
	-	use BmMemFiler::StatusText() to redirect the final remaining
		parsing errors from the error-popup to the ParsingError-collection.
		Now, parsing errors should never lead to the error-popup being shown.

BmDataModel:
	-	added simple visitor pattern implementation - ForEachItem().

BmMail, BmMailEditWin, BmMailFolder, BmMailFolderList, BmPopAccount, 
BmPrefsRecvMailView:
	-	moved names of system folders from BmMail into BmMailFolder, adjusted
		references to these folders accordingly.

BmMailFolderView:
	-	simplified special sorting of system-folders (what did the space-appended
		names do in here?).

BmMemIO:
	-	added support for a general status-text to BmMemFilter.

BmRosterBase, BmGuiRoster:
	-	added support for finding out whether or not an address is known
		as people file.

BmSpamFilter:
	-	added support for avoiding mails from known addresses from being
		seen as SPAM.
	-	added support for filing unsure SPAM into the 'quarantine'-folder.
	-	improved behaviour of SpamOMeter sessions.

SpamOMeter:
	-	changed way how we pass-back success/error information, as exit-code
		doesn't work for the way SpamOMeter is being called from Beam.

< 2005-05-12: commit >

BeamApp:
	-	implemented support for importing mail-addresses into people files.

BmMailHeader:
	-	added methods for counting the number of instances of a specific field.
	-	added support for accessing a fields value by index (not only first
		value, as before).

BmMailHeaderView:
	-	implemented support for importing mail-addresses into people files.
	-	fixed bug with multiple instances of non-address fields not being
	 	shown in header-display.
	-	added support for displaying header-fields only if they have content
		(appending a ? to the field-name triggers this behavi86.

< 2005-07-03: commit >

BmMenuControl:
	-	fixed layouting code such that the vertical size and position always
		match the ones used by a BmTextControl that has a menu as its label.

BmPrefsFilterView:
	-	fixed min height being too small for 13pt font.

BmBodyPartList, BmBodyPartView, BmEncoding, BmMailView:
	-	use BmMemFiler::StatusText() to redirect the final remaining
		parsing errors from the error-popup to the ParsingError-collection.
		Now, parsing errors should never lead to the error-popup being shown.

BmDataModel:
	-	added simple visitor pattern implementation - ForEachItem().

BmMail, BmMailEditWin, BmMailFolder, BmMailFolderList, BmPopAccount, 
BmPrefsRecvMailView:
	-	moved names of system folders from BmMail into BmMailFolder, adjusted
		references to these folders accordingly.

BmMailFolderView:
	-	simplified special sorting of system-folders (what did the space-appended
		names do in here?).

BmMemIO:
	-	added support for a general status-text to BmMemFilter.

BmRosterBase, BmGuiRoster:
	-	added support for finding out whether or not an address is known
		as people file.

BmSpamFilter:
	-	added support for avoiding mails from known addresses from being
		seen as SPAM.
	-	added support for filing unsure SPAM into the 'quarantine'-folder.
	-	improved behaviour of SpamOMeter sessions.

SpamOMeter:
	-	changed way how we pass-back success/error information, as exit-code
		doesn't work for the way SpamOMeter is being called from Beam.

< 2005-05-12: commit >

BeamApp:
	-	implemented support for importing mail-addresses into people files.

BmMailHeader:
	-	added methods for counting the number of instances of a specific field.
	-	added support for accessing a fields value by index (not only first
		value, as before).

BmMailHeaderView:
	-	implemented support for importing mail-addresses into people files.
	-	fixed bug with multiple instances of non-address fields not being
	 	shown in header-display.
	-	added support for displaying header-fields only if they have content
		(appending a ? to the field-name triggers this behavi86.

< 2005-07-03: commit >

BmMenuControl:
	-	fixed layouting code such that the vertical size and position always
		match the ones used by a BmTextControl that has a menu as its label.

BmPrefsFilterView:
	-	fixed min height being too small for 13pt font.

BmTextControl:
	-	minor cleanup.

< 2005-07-01: commit >

BmListControllerView, BmMailFolderView, BmMailRefView:
	-	implemented hierarchical state-info handling, such that a folder inherits
		the state-info from its parent, but can (explicitly) disconnect from it.
		This should make setting up the preferred listview layout much easier.
	-	The default ref-list layout is now much simpler (lots of columns have
		been hidden).

BmMailEditWin:
	-	fixed bug with signature not automatically being applied to mail when
		a new identity is selected.

BmMailFolder:
	-	now stores info about if the corresponding ref-list's layout is connected
		to parent or not.

BmMailHeader:
	-	fixed bug with 'Name'-attribute not being set for outbound mails.

BmMailViewWin:
	-	added RefListView, such that navigation is possible and independent
		of main window. The RefListView is hidden by default, but can be shown
		by means dragging the split-view at the top downwards.

BmPrefs:
	-	added default shortcuts for the two new menu-cmds 'Previous Message' &
		'Next Message'.

BmWindow:
	-	added message filter for scrollwheel events, which redirects these events
		to the view that currently is under the mouse (suggested by Stephan Aßmus).

ColumnListView:
	-	fixed drawing artefacts when dragging a window across the view (single-
		line updates were not handled correctly).

UserResizeSplitView (and several other files):
	-	added support for auto-hiding a child if the available space is smaller
		than the child's minimum size.

BmSpamFilter:
	-	oops: the three different instances (classify, learn-as-spam and 
	   learn-as-tofu) all had their own dataset, but only the classify-dataset
	   was actually changed by prefs. Now there's only one (static) dataset left.

< 2005-05-20: commit >

BmToolbarButton:
	-	fixed broken support for toolbar backgrounds, which didn't work properly
		for images that need a certain tile size in horizontal direction.

< 2005-04-14: commit >

BmBodyPartView:
	-	added support for specifying src- and dest-charset for text-attachments.
		This is especially useful if you need to send non-UTF8 attachments.

BmCaption:
	-	major cleanup, why on earth was this inheriting from BStringView
		(it didn't use any of its features)???
	-	added proper clipping of caption text.

BmMail:
	-	fixed problem in Store() when asked to store attributes only and
		needed to move mail into another folder, too (used to throw in that 
		case).

BmMailFilter:
	-	execute LearnAsSpam- and LearnAsTofu-Filters before handling any
		other requests, such that these can change every aspect of the filter
		*before* it is being dealt with.
		
BmMailView:
	-	added support for incremental searching the mailtext.

BmMailViewWin, BmMainWindow:
	-	activated Find and Find Next menus as we now have incremental search

BmSpamFilter:
	-	corrected computation of ratioSpam (got the sign wrong).

< 2005-03-30: commit >

BmMail:
	-	BmMail::Store() now supports storing the attributes of a mail only.
		This optimization boosts filtering performance quite a lot, since
		filters never change the mail-text, they only need to rewrite the
		attributes.

BmMailEditWin, BmMailFilter, BmPopper:
	-	adjusted to updated BmMail::Store() signature.

< 2005-03-28: commit >

BmGuiRoster:
	-	minor clarification.

BmListController:
	-	in WriteStateCache() we only write the cache if the model has actually
		completed (as writing an incomplete cache is no good). This fixes the
		bug that caused Beam to lose state of mail-folders when the user quits
		Beam before the mail-folders have been shown.

BmMail:
	-	added on-demand-creation of spam-folder.

BmMailFolderList:
	-	removed unneeded locking around initialization/instantiation, which
		allows Beam to quit, even when the mail-folders aren't set up yet.

BmMailRef:
	-	we need to update the display even if we couldn't read the 
		'RatioSpam'-attribute.

BmMailRefList:
	-	we now automatically trigger a rewrite of the cache when we had to
		integrated appended archives during the load.

BmMailRefView:
	-	we now map 'Genuine'-classification to 'Tofu', since that's how we
		call it in other places.

BmSpamFilter, SpamOMeter:
	-	implemented training of filter through querying for SPAM-/TOFU-mails
		and sending these through SpamOMeter.

BmSieveFilter, BmMailFilter:
	-	added support for learning matching mails as SPAM or TOFU.

MailConverter:
	-	added usage-info.

< 2005-03-19: commit >

BeamApp, BmApp:
	-	moved checking for ref-leaks to proper place (into BmApp).

BmFilter:
	-	removed GetStatistics-filter, as it isn't needed (since user has no
		direct access to it).
	-	added missing jobSpecs param when calling addon's Execute().

BmJobStatusWin, BmMainWindow:
	-	added support for LearnAsSpam- & LearnAsTofu-filtering.

BmMail:
	-	finished support for Classification- and RatioSpam-attribute.

BmMailFilter:
	-	added support for setting Classification- and RatioSpam-attributes.

BmMailRef:
	-	fixed some bugs in handling of RatioSpam-attribute.

BmMailRefView
	-	added support for LearnAsSpam- & LearnAsTofu-filtering.
	-	activated new columns Classification and RatioSpam.

BmMailFolderView:
	-	integrated spam-folder into special sorting order for system folders.

BmSpamFilter:
	-	implemented prefs-GUI.
	-	added support for getting & resetting statistics.
	-	now returns more useful results via msgContext when learning.

< 2005-03-14: commit >

BeamApp:
	-	declare ourselves as non-testing app.

BmFilterAddon, BmFilter, BmMailFilter, BmSieveFilter:
	-	refactored filter-interface such that it is a bit more versatile,
		now BMessages are used for data-interchange and as job-specifier-
		description.

BmLogHandler:
	-	added BmLogHandler::Shutdown(), for easier cleanup.

BmMail, BmMailRef:
	-	implemented MarkAsSpam() & MarkAsTofu(), as well as support for the
		underlying attributes ("Classification" & "RatioSpam")

BmMailRefView, BmWindow:
	-	added support for triggering the context-menu via the B_MENU-key (a
		modifier).

BmMemIO:
	-	added defalt constructor for BmStringIBuf

BmSpamFilter:
	-	finished implementation, cross-checked with crm114-behaviour on Linux.
	-	added all internal filters neccessary for use in Beam (LearnAsSpam,
		LearnAsTofu, Reset, GetStatistics).
	-	ran many tests (with SpamOMeter) in order to determine good default
		settings (--rts=5 --rtt=20 is very good with my own corpus as well
		as the one from SpamAssassin).

SpamOMeter: 
	-	added

< 2005-02-21: commit >

many files:
	-	refactored BmApplication and BmRoster into separate classes, such
		that other applications (than Beam) can make use of bmMailKit more
		easily.

< 2005-02-16: commit >

BmBodyPartList:
	-	improved HasAttachmenst() such that it only indicates a mail having
		attachments when there is a multipart-bodypart and if this one has
		actually more than one child.

BmFilterAddon:
	-	added spamValue to msgContext.
	-	the Execute() method of a filter-addon can now specify a certain
		job type.

BmMail, BmMailRef, BmMailRefList:
	-	added spam-related attributes that MDR has introduced (we will use
		them, too, in order to stay compatible).

BmPopper, BmSmtp:
	-	added transfer-speed logging for mails larger than 100KB

BmRoster:
	-	fixed non-working shortcuts in class ListMenuBuilder.
	
BmSieveFilter:
	-	the Execute() method of a filter-addon can now specify a certain
		job type.

BmSpamFilter:
	-	the Execute() method of a filter-addon can now specify a certain
		job type.
	-	added support for learning as spam/tofu (each of which is a 
		specific job type).

< 2005-02-02: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmPopAccount, BmSmtpAccount:
	-	fixed incorrect uppercasing of <auto> - mode.

BmSmtp:
	-	made support for AUTH ... and AUTH=... more obvious.

< 2005-02-02: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmPopAccount, BmPopper, BmPrefsRecvMailView, BmPrefsSendMailView,
BmSmtp, BmSmtpAccount:
	-	added automatic detection of best authentication mode.

< 2005-02-02: commit >

BmMailView:
	-	exclude commas from URIs in the highlighting code.

BmEncoding:
	-	added support for transparent filter-tags to BmMemFilter (each specific
		filter can add/implement tags that it requires).
	-	base64-encoder now supports encoding to a single line (which is required
		by the DIGEST-MD5 and CRAM-MD5 authentication algorithms).

BmMemIO:
	-	added support for transparent filter-tags to BmMemFilter (each specific
		filter can add/implement tags that it requires).

BmNetJobModel, BmPopper, BmSmtp:
	-	added support for DIGEST-MD5 and CRAM-MD5 authentication

BmPopAccount, BmSmtpAccount:
	-	added support for DIGEST-MD5 and CRAM-MD5 authentication

BmPrefsRecvMailView, BmPrefsSendMailView:
	-	added support for DIGEST-MD5 and CRAM-MD5 authentication

BmString, BmUtil:
	-	moved BM_DEFAULT_STRING from BmUtil to BmString.

md5:
	-	added MD5Sum() and MD5_HMAC().

BmSpamFilter:
	-	adjusted to use of transparent filter-tags with BmMemFilter.

< 2005-01-18: commit >

BmMemIO:
	-	removed superfluous BmMemOBuf class
	-	added BmMemBufConsumer
	-	minor cleanups

BmNetJobModel:
	-	removed BmMemOBuf

BmSieveFilter:
	-	fixed problem with script not being compiled after it has been changed.

BmSpamFilter:
	-	finished porting the OSBF-classifier from crm114.

BmString:
	-	added operator << double

< 2005-01-14: commit >

BmFilter, BmFilterAddon, BmSieveFilter, SieveTest:
	-	added support for Initialize()-method which is called right after
		a filter has been setup, such that all sieve-filters will compile
		their script immediately after instantiation, not on demand.
		This way, the idle-time after Beam-startup is used for script-
		compilation, which feels faster (especially since the compilation
		now doesn't hit the performance when first checking for mails).

< 2005-01-14: commit >

BmBodyPartList:
	-	renamed ID() to Id(), as this collides with a #define inside of
		a lexer in libsieve (yuck!).

BmFilterAddon, BmMailFilter, BmSieveFilter, SieveTest:
	-	reworked data-interface, instead of passing every possible argument
		as explicit data-element, we now simply include a BmMail-pointer inside
		a BmMsgContext. This makes each addon depend on bmMailKit.so, but that
		doesn't hurt, as this is already part of Beam.

BmRoster:
	-	fixed bug with RebuildStatusMenu() not adding the new status to the
		message.

BmSpamFilter:
	-	added creation/reading of data files.

< 2005-01-13: commit >

BmFilter, BmPrefsFilterView:
	-	every kind of filter can now supply a default name for its filters
		(used by spam-filter to differ from 'new filter').
	-	minor formatting cleanups

BmGuiUtil, BmRoster:
	-	moved AddListToMenu() from BmGuiUtil to BmRoster and refactored
		it into the class ListMenuBuilder.
	-	added support for specifying a filter-functor that is called for
		every list-item.

BmMailRefView:
	-	in AddMailRefMenu() make use of RebuildStatusMenu().

BmResources:
	-	improved translator-useage to such an extent that we try to
		load the PNG-translator explicitly, in order to avoid instantiating
		all available translators (which happens if the PNG-translator can't
		be found). This change lifts 200KB off Beam's memory footprint!
		
BuildSettings:
	-	switched from -O2 to -O3 and added -fstrict-aliasing.

BmSpamFilter:
	-	added SPAM-filter skeleton.

< 2005-01-12: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

comparator:
	-	fixed bug in i;ascii-numeric with incorrect results when
		comparing non-numerical values to numerical ones.

script:
	-	fixed bug with non-existant headers not having a :count of 0.
	-	fixed :count not working at all with multiple headers.

SieveTest:
	-	completed relational tests (with numerical :count and :value).

< 2005-01-12: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmListController:
	-	fixed possible redrawing issue when adding items.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	making use of explicit resource-name passing in order to cause the
		'Attach'-Toolbar to show (but use the 'Attachment'-resource).

BmToolbarButton:
	-	added support for passing the resource-name explicitly (as opposed
		to using the label).

ColumnListView:
	-	added assertion to ReSortItem().

libsieve:
	-	added relational operators
	-	added numerical comparator
	-	changed semantics of address :all :is "From" "root" to match the
		string "root" instead of "root@unspecified-domain" (which I think
		is quite counter-intuitive).

BmSieveFilter:
	-	errors in Header-test are now correctly propagated.

BmSieveTest:
	-	added complete testcases for the Address-, Exists-, Header- and 
		relational tests.

WrappingTextView:
	-	in read-only mode, B_END and B_HOME are now mapped to vertical
		scrollbar (as the default, horizontal scrolling is useless).

< 2004-11-18: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmMailViewWin, BmMainWindow:
	- consolidated text/icon-name of 'Delete'-Button to be 'Trash', as
     the icon is named this way. Now the icon shows again... 

SieveTest:
	- added tests for basic SIEVE-tests (true, false, anyof, allof, ...)

< 2004-11-17: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmFilterAddon, BmMailFilter, BmSieveTest:
	- added action-tests for SIEVE-filters.
	- activated reject-support (but is still a dummy)

MainBuildRules:
	- added support for specifying object-files directly in the libs-line of
	  LinkAgainst.	

< 2004-11-14: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmMailEditWinPart2:
	-	removed, since gcc-2.95.3 compiles BmMailEditWin.cpp just fine.
	
src-tests/Jamfile:
	-	removed TestBeamMini and TestBeamMicro, since libstdc++.r4.so works
		fine now (std::string has a threadsafe allocator).

MailMonitorTest:
	-	robustified moving of mails in order to cope with mailbox and /var/tmp
		living on different volumes.

BmApp, BmBodyPartView, BmMailEditWin, BmMailFolderView, BmMailRefView,
BmMailViewWin, BmMainWindow, BmPrefsGeneralView, BmResources, 
BmToolbarButton, BmBusyView, CLVEasyItem:
	-	added support for switching toolbar-layout and -icons on the fly.
	   We currently leak all loaded bitmaps, but I chose to ignore this,
	   as switching icons shouldn't be *that* frequent.

BmJobStatusWin:
	-	avoid getting the focus if in click-to-focus mode, such that we
		do not get in the user's way.

src-bmBase/Jamfile:
	-	libstdc++ is no longer neccessary, so do not link against it.

< 2004-09-13: commit >

BmMultiLocker:
	-	simplified Spinlock by making use of atomic_or.

regexx.cc:
	-	fixed namespace issue with definition of BM_REGEXX_DEFAULT_STRING.

< 2004-07-19: commit >

BmMailFilter:
	-	fixed problem with status always being set, even if no change occurred.

BmMultiLocker, Jamfile(s), MultiLockerTest:
	-	added own implementation of a multiple reader, single writer lock.
	-	this improves upon BMultiLocker to such an extent that:
		+	a thread which already has a read-lock and tries to become the 
			writer doesn't deadlock, but becomes the writer once all (other)
			read-locks have been freed.
		+	a writer can ask for read-locks without causing deadlock.
		+	proper read-lock nesting is supported and IsReadLocked() works
			(instead of always returning true).

MemIoTest:
	cosmetics

< 2004-07-10: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmApp:
	-	removed an unneeded spinlock.
	-	start reading of pop-account list before showing the main-window,
		such that the main-window can wait on the pop-account list.

BmMailRefList:
	-	fixed a bug that caused rebuilding the cache to not work at all.

BmMainWindow:
	-	wait for the pop-account list in order to make the shortcuts work
		first time.

BmMenuControllerBase:
	-	now we update the list whenever the shortcuts change, too.

BmRoster:
	-	added missing support for shortcuts in RebuildList().

BuildSettings:
	-	fixed use of $BUILD_DEBUG instead of $(BUILD_DEBUG)

< 2004-07-09: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmMailEditWin:
	-	more juggling around the internal compiler error...

BmMailFolderView:
	-	fixed problem with New/Mails-columns being shown too far right
		(outside the visible area).

BmMailQuery, BmStorageUtil:
	-	we no longer use the Trash's node-ref but we use the path in order
		to determine whether or not a mail lives inside the trash.

BmMainWindow:
	-	title no longer includes version string, as Alan correctly pointed
		out that most apps just use their name (not the version).

BmPrefs, 
	-	simplified determination of (default) icon-path
	-	replaced TrashNodeRef by TrashPath.

BmPrefsGeneralView:
	-	simplified determination of (default) icon-path
	-	fixed error when selecting the icon-path for the first time.

< 2004-07-07: commit >

BmMail:
	-	added mail-status 'Error'.

BmSmtp:
	-	when an error occurs during send, we now log the error and skip the
		mail, marking it as erraneous. So any further mails will be send (if
		possible).

BmIcons.rsrc:
	-	fixed a few glitches with respect to drawing the icons over different 
		background colors.

BmSieveFilter:
	-	added some more log info.

< 2004-07-06: commit >

BmBodyPartList, BmEncoding, BmMailHeader:
	-	added (very simplistic) automatic charset detection in case of 
		conversion errors (both inbound and outbound).
		For inbound detection, a proper detection algorithm would yield
		much better results, but we stick with our try-some approach (for now).

BmMailEditWin:
	-	if automatic charset detection succeeds during save/send, we
		select the charset-menu accordingly, such that the user knows what's
		been going on.

BmMailHeaderView:
	-	dropped superfluous error-msg.
	
BmMailView:
	-	in JobIsDone() we now reset mParsingErrors, such that we do not show
		errors that were actually found during last try...

BmPrefs:
	-	added two new (list-)fields, 'AutoCharsetsInbound' and 
		'AutoCharsetsOutbound', which define the charsets to be used during

			read-locks have been freed.
		+	a writer can ask for read-locks without causing deadlock.

BmMailView:
	-	mail-parsing errors no longer trigger the error-window as this is
		too tedious (spam often deliberately announces wrong encoding).
		We now indicate any problems with an error-icon inside the busy-view.
		Hovering over this icons shows the error-message as tool-tip.

BmLogWindow:

< 2004-06-29: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmIdentity, BmMailHeader, BmPrefsIdentityView:
	-	added support for default-headers, which make it possible to setup
		an identity such that every mail from that identity has (e.g.) a
		specific Bcc-header.

BmMail:
	-	we now replace any binary nulls in the mailtext by a space.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	we no longer send all pending mails for the SMTP-account, but we
		just send this single mail.
	-	added support for default-headers (and changing these as the user
		selects another identity).

BmMailFilter, BmFilterChain, BmPrefsFilterChainView:
	-	dropped support for two outgoing filter-chains, as it doesn't make
		any sense to me any more (let's see if that changes again...).

BmMailQuery:
	-	we no longer deal with mails living in Trash...
	-	instead of collecting fullblown mails we collect entry-refs instead,
		which is faster and uses less memory...

BmMailRef, BmMailRefList:
	-	pulled fetching of stat-info inside BmMailRef-construction, unless
		it is present anyway.

BmMainWindow:
	-	activated "Send All Pending Mails"-menu (i.e. no more 'World Peace').
	-	added send-pending sub-menu (with one entry for each smtp-account).

BmPrefs:
	-	added public member TrashNodeRef, which is the node-ref of the
		Trash-directory on the mailbox-volume.

BmPrefsSendMailView:
	-	for smtp-after-pop we now require the pop-account to be set in the
		prefs.

BmSieveFilter:
	-	changed layout (hopefully to be cleaner now).

BmSmtpAccount, BmSmtp, BmJobStatusWin:
	-	restructured handling of pending mails: Instead of holding the
		pending mails inside the account, we now pass them on to the
		job-window, which in turn stuffs them inside the smtp-job.
	-	added support for sending a single, specified mail.

TextEntryAlert:
	-	fixed bug that always caused an empty result string.

< 2004-06-25: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmBodyPartList:
	-	fixed incorrect handling of attachment-filenames that contain slashes.

BmDataModel:
	-	instead of checking whether the model is locked in empty() and size(),
		we now explicitly lock it instead. It's just begin() and end() where
		we require the model to be locked by the caller.

BmFilter:
	-	fixed incorrect signature of SanityCheck().

BmFilterChain, BmMailFilter:
	-	simplified sorting of filter inside chain.

BmGuiUtil, BmMailView, BmMainWindow, BmRoster:
	-	added missing locks when accessing a model's item-map.

BmListController:
	-	added missing locks for adding, removing and updating items.

BmMail, BmMailFactory:
	-	centralized initialization of a mail from given identity-data into
		the new method SetupFromIdentityAndRecvAddr().

BmbarButton, BmBusyView, CLVEasyItem:
	-	added support for switching toolbar-layout and -icons on the fly.
	   We currently leak all loaded bitmaps, but I chose to ignore this,

BmMultiLocker, Jamfile(s), MultiLockerTest:

		+	a thread which already has a read-lock and tries to become the 
			writer doesn't deadlock, but becomes the writer once all (other)
			read-locks have been freed.
		+	a writer can ask for read-locks without causing deadlock.

< 2004-06-29: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmIdentity, BmMailHeader, BmPrefsIdentityView:
	-	added support for default-headers, which make it possible to setup
		an identity such that every mail from that identity has (e.g.) a
		specific Bcc-header.

BmMail:
	-	we now replace any binary nulls in the mailtext by a space.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	we no longer send all pending mails for the SMTP-account, but we
		just send this single mail.
	-	added support for default-headers (and changing these as the user
		selects another identity).

BmMailFilter, BmFilterChain, BmPrefsFilterChainView:
	-	dropped support for two outgoing filter-chains, as it doesn't make
		any sense to me any more (let's see if that changes again...).

BmMailQuery:
	-	we no longer deal with mails living in Trash...
	-	instead of collecting fullblown mails we collect entry-refs instead,
		which is faster and uses less memory...

BmMailRef, BmMailRefList:
	-	pulled fetching of stat-info inside BmMailRef-construction, unless
		it is present anyway.

BmMainWindow:
	-	activated "Send All Pending Mails"-menu (i.e. no more 'World Peace').
	-	added send-pending sub-menu (with one entry for each smtp-account).

BmPrefs:
	-	added public member TrashNodeRef, which is the node-ref of the
		Trash-directory on the mailbox-volume.

BmPrefsSendMailView:
	-	for smtp-after-pop we now require the pop-account to be set in the
		prefs.

BmSieveFilter:
	-	changed layout (hopefully to be cleaner now).

BmSmtpAccount, BmSmtp, BmJobStatusWin:
	-	restructured handling of pending mails: Instead of holding the
		pending mails inside the account, we now pass them on to the
		job-window, which in turn stuffs them inside the smtp-job.
	-	added support for sending a single, specified mail.

TextEntryAlert:
	-	fixed bug that always caused an empty result string.

< 2004-06-28: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmApp:
	-	we only start slaves for tasks beyond a certain size (mail-count).

BmMailEditWin, BuildSettings:
	-	applied Alan's patches for ZETA.

< 2004-06-25: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmDividable:
	-	fixed compilation issue under Dano.

		not working.

BmMailFolder:
	-	reduced usage of RefListLocker to the minimum.

< 2004-06-25: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmBodyPartList:
	-	fixed incorrect handling of attachment-filenames that contain slashes.

BmDataModel:
	-	instead of checking whether the model is locked in empty() and size(),
		we now explicitly lock it instead. It's just begin() and end() where
		we require the model to be locked by the caller.

BmFilter:
	-	fixed incorrect signature of SanityCheck().

BmFilterChain, BmMailFilter:
	-	simplified sorting of filter inside chain.

BmGuiUtil, BmMailView, BmMainWindow, BmRoster:
	-	added missing locks when accessing a model's item-map.

BmListController:
	-	added missing locks for adding, removing and updating items.

BmMail, BmMailFactory:
	-	centralized initialization of a mail from given identity-data into
		the new method SetupFromIdentityAndRecvAddr().

BmMailEditWin:
	-	seemingly "solved" the internal compiler error phenomenon...

BmMailFolderList:
	-	added missing lock in FindMailRefByKey().

BmMailHeaderView:
	-	fixed a bug that caused incorrect baseline-alignment between title-
		and content-view that occurred with fonts having a leading>0.

BmIdentity, BmPrefsIdentityView:
	-	added support for configuring the reply-to header.

BmPrefs*View:
	-	simplified SanityCheck()-mechanics.

BuildSettings:
	-	added new lib-path /boot/beos/system/lib such that libnetapi.so is
		found on all systems (even when the link from /boot/devel/lib/x86
		is missing, as is the case for Dano and Zeta).

< 2004-06-23: commit >

BmFilterChain, BmMail, BmMailFilter, BmPrefsFilterChainView:
	-	split outgoing chains into two: pre-edit and pre-send.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	yet more wrestling with internal compiler errors, yuck!

BmMailRefView:
	-	added default-types to forward- & reply-submenu in order to make
		things clearer. The submenu-controlling item still is an alternative 
		way to trigger the default action.

BmMailView:
	-	added options for URL- and sig-highlighting.

BmPopper:
	-	adjusted to filter-related interface-changes in BmMail.

BmResources:
	-	cosmetical changes.

BmRoster:
	-	adjusted to interface-changes for TextEntryAlert.

	-	fixed wrong signature of InstantiateFilterPrefsView(), which lead
		to a crash when opening the prefs-window.

	-	cosmetical changes.

BuildSettings:
	-	now we no longer strip apps by default.

	-	changed output-type from char-buffer to BmString.

split, regexx:
	-	cosmetical changes.

< 2004-06-14: commit >

		no more BeIDE-projects).

BmApp:
	-	added MAIL:status to the required indices.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	split BmMailEditWin into two parts in order to avoid internal compiler
		errors. Now it seems to work for both gcc-991026 and gcc000224.
	-	fixed race-condition and possible crashes during sending of mails
		(was reading/writing unprotected vector).

BmMailQuery:
	-	added this, providing a somewhat general interface to query for mails.

BmPrefs*View:
	-	removed many options now considered superfluous (can still be changed
		through direct prefs-file editing).

BmRoster:
	-	added BmRoster-class which defines an interface through which add-ons
		and libraries can ask the running app for specific info.

BmSmtpAccount, BmSmtp:
	-	we now use a pending mail query in order to determine which mails
		to send.

< 2004-06-08: commit >

BmApp, BmMail, BmMailFactory, BmPrefsMailConstrView:
	-	moved mail-creating functions out into BmMailFactory.

BmBodyPartView:
	-	made BmBodyPartItem invisible.
	-	reduced compile-time dependencies.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	started to tackle the compilation problems with gcc000224, which
		exposes quite a problem related to template-code. Whoa!

	-	added missing new files.

bmBase, libRegexx, SantaPartsForBeam:
	-	now make use of _IMPORT & _EXPORT

< 2004-06-03: commit >

	-	rewrote method for add-ons to access info from Beam.

BmSieveFilter:
	-	added support for manual filing of outgoing messages.

	-	removed superfluous filtering, this is now done before the mail
		is being sent.

BmToolbarButton:
	-	added support for dynamically updating variations before menu is
		shown.
		
MultiLineTextControl:
	-	corrected colors for drawing deep bevel.

sieve-lex:
	-	the lexer used to eat backslashes, which is no good if parsing
		regexes. So we now do not skip backslashes anymore.

Jamfile, Jamrules, build-jam:
	-	added a first draft of a jam-based build-environment.

makefiles, project-files:

< 2004-05-29: commit >

BmApp:
	-	split initialization of BmResources such that parts of it can access

	-	dropped people will now appear with the same format as the ones being
		selected from the people-menu.
	-	stripped toolbar to contain only the required buttons.

< 2004-05-07: commit, moved tag 'current-devel' >

BmEncoding:
	-	removed spurious addition of Escape to the characters safe for 
		qp-encoding, i.e. it would not be encoded. I can't remember the
		reason why I had added it, and it looks strange now. Maybe it
		has to do with japanese encoding (that uses Esc a lot), but I
		don't know.

< 2004-05-07: commit >

BmEncoding:
	-	fixed bug in base64-decoder that chokes on embedded padding chars.
		Unfortunately, Beam is producing these by itself when it concatenates
		several encoded-words into one string.

BmListController:
	-	in UpdateModelItem(), we now only redraw the item if it is visible
		at all.

BmMail:
	-	fixed bug with generating backup-name for mails with very long names.

BmMailFolderList:
	-	we now filter out second event of a single B_ENTRY_MOVED node-monitor
		message as we want to handle it only once.

< 2004-04-27: commit >

BmController:
	-	removed left-overs from profiling

BmListController:
	-	added some more logging
	-	cosmetical changes

BmDataModel, BmMailFolder, BmMailRef, BmMailRefList:
	-	implemented appending archives to cache for the case when the
		cache isn't loaded. This speeds up use of long folders that are
		the target of mail-filters, as the cache no longer needs to be
		thrown away.

BmMemIO:
	-	removed ugly minSize-crutch.

BmRefManager:
	-	STL-related cleanups.

ColumnListView:
	-	AssertWindowLocked() works only in debug-mode from now on.

		exact position of a conversion-problem in the mail-text.

BmFilter:
	-	minor cleanup

	-	when replying to a mail from ourselves, we use the original
		sender as the target (not ourselves). This has been suggested
		by Ingo Weinhold.

BmMailRefView:
	-	streamlined dragging-code (now we draw up to 10 items).

BmSieveFilter:
	-	fixed bugs in match-line removal code (we now move the model-data
		accordingly, too, not just the GUI-contents).

CLVEasyItem:
	-	constructor now respects the AvoidColPushing-flag of the listview

CLVListItem:
	-	cosmetical fixes

ColumnListView:
	-	added flag fAvoidColPushing
	-	fixed resorting-problem which caused an item to jump to the end
		of similar items. Now this item just stays in place if sorting
		order hasn't changed.

Readme:
	- added reference to PCRE

< 2003-12-18: commit>

< 2004-05-07: commit >

BmEncoding:
	-	fixed bug in base64-decoder that chokes on embedded padding chars.
		Unfortunately, Beam is producing these by itself when it concatenates
		several encoded-words into one string.

BmListController:
	-	in UpdateModelItem(), we now only redraw the item if it is visible
		at all.

BmMail:
	-	fixed bug with generating backup-name for mails with very long names.

BmMailFolderList:
	-	cosmetical changes

BmMailRef:
	-	in ResyncFromDisk() we call TellModelItemUpdated() only if anything
		has in fact changed.

Base64DecoderTest:
	-	added test that checks for correct handling of embedded padding
		chars.

< 2004-05-04: commit >

BmMail, BmPrefsMailConstrView:
	-	added support for %FA and %FN macros in reply-/forward-intro.

BmMailFolderList:
	-	we now filter out second event of a single B_ENTRY_MOVED node-monitor
		message as we want to handle it only once.

< 2004-04-27: commit >

BmController:
	-	removed left-overs from profiling

BmListController:
	-	added some more logging
	-	cosmetical changes

BmDataModel, BmMailFolder, BmMailRef, BmMailRefList:
	-	implemented appending archives to cache for the case when the
		cache isn't loaded. This speeds up use of long folders that are
		the target of mail-filters, as the cache no longer needs to be
		thrown away.

BmMemIO:
	-	removed ugly minSize-crutch.

BmRefManager:
	-	STL-related cleanups.

ColumnListView:
	-	AssertWindowLocked() works only in debug-mode from now on.

many files:
	-	A first try at establishing compatibility with Dano/Zeta UI-colors.

< 2004-04-04: commit >

BmBodyPartList:
	-	added MimeTypeIsPotentiallyHarmful()-predicate

BmBodyPartView:
	-	moved judgement about harmfulness of a given bodypart out into
		BmBodyPart for clarity
	-	cleaned up invocation and dragging of attachments.

BmEncoding:
	-	fixed incorrect positioning of cursor when trying to show the
		exact position of a conversion-problem in the mail-text.

BmFilter:
	-	minor cleanup

BmMail:
	-	when replying to a mail from ourselves, we use the original
		sender as the target (not ourselves). This has been suggested
		by Ingo Weinhold.

BmMailRefView:
	-	streamlined dragging-code (now we draw up to 10 items).

BmSieveFilter:
	-	fixed bugs in match-line removal code (we now move the model-data
		accordingly, too, not just the GUI-contents).

CLVEasyItem:
	-	constructor now respects the AvoidColPushing-flag of the listview

CLVListItem:
	-	cosmetical fixes

ColumnListView:
	-	added flag fAvoidColPushing
	-	fixed resorting-problem which caused an item to jump to the end
		of similar items. Now this item just stays in place if sorting
		order hasn't changed.

< 2004-02-22: commit>

Readme:
	- added reference to PCRE

< 2003-12-18: commit>

many files:
	-	some more optimisations concerning use of memory.
	-	finished work on streamlining the update-semantics of listview-
		items.
	-	fixed sorting issues with new update-semantics.

BmApp:
	-	removed unneeded (and erraneous) showing of main-window in
		AppActivated(). R5 just doesn't exhibit this problem, but Zeta
		does...

BmStorageUtil:
	-	changed BmReadStringAttr() to return a bool that indicates
		whether or not the attribute has actually changed from the
		current value passed in via outStr.


< 2003-12-09: commit>

many files:
	-	reworked ColumnListView-Update semantics to be finer grained
		and to use less memory.

BmDataModel:
	-	added OutlineLevel() to BmListMoo now use the BmBackedFile-class.

BmMailFolderList:
	-	cosmetical changes.

BmMailRef:
	-	added missing member-initializers for mWhen and mWhenCreated.

BmSmtp:
	-	added missing member-initializer for mCurrMailSize.

BmStorageUtils:
	-	added BmBackedFile, a file with automatic backup.

BmEncoding:
	-	removed spurious addition of Escape to the characters safe for 
		qp-encoding, i.e. it would not be encoded. I can't remember the
		reason why I had added it, and it looks strange now. Maybe it
		has to do with japanese encoding (that uses Esc a lot), but I
		don't know.
