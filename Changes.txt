change-history of Beam:
		$Id$

v0.912, 2002-04-14
	-	better support for forwarding & replying to multiple messages at once,
		now you can choose whether or not to join the messages.
	-	added support for printing one or more messages.
	-	corrected some MIME-problems, increasing robustness and eliminating 
		the compatibility-problems Beam had with other mail-programs 
		(like Mail-It or Eudora). These programs now accept Beam-generated 
		MIME-messages, including quoted-printables and attachments.
	-	doubleclicking a folder now opens the corresponding Tracker-window.
	-	deactivating the Desktop-icon does work now.
	-	added configurable delay before a shown mail is being marked as read.
	-	added option for using 8-bit-mime when constructing mails.
	-	added an option to switch between soft/hard-wrapping of the mailtext 
		(Beam always used soft-wrapping before).
	-	when requested, Beam can now contact a POP3/SMTP-server and suggest 
		the best (most "secure") authentication type.
	-	and other (minor) bugfixes, usability and GUI-enhancements.

v0.911, 2002-03-24
	-	fixed stupid bug that caused Beam to crash if no FolderView-state
		exists (like after first install)
	-	forwarding attachments works correctly now

v0.91, 2002-03-24
	-	header-view contents are now selectable and draggable.
	-	added support for redirecting mails.
	-	Beam now works under Dano (BeOS 5.1).
	-	signature support added (for static and dynamic signatures).
	-	added automatic mail-checking (every xx minutes).
	-	all shortcuts are now configurable via prefs.
	-	added better quoting-modes (simple, push-margin and auto-wrap)
		in order to reduce comb-like effect.
	-	added option to show in- & out-folders always at top.
	-	added tooltips to all preferences-controls, which is one step
		on the way to better usability (but Online-Help still missing).
	-	added Deskbar icon indicating the presence of new mail.
		(This seems to constantly crash the R5 Deskbar, but it works
		for OpenTracker & Dano versions...)
	-	Display-font can now be selected when viewing/editing mails.
	-	Beam can now set itself up as preferred email application.
	-	fixed problems with node-monitoring stopping to work after a
		recreate-cache.
	-	Beam now correctly shows BeOS standard-icons for mails, if 
		Beam is preferred app.
	-	fixed incorrect mail-address creation in case of phrases containing
		commas (like: Meyer, Justin <xx@yyy.zz>). This would now be created
		as "Meyer, Justin" <xx@yyy.zz>.
	-	fixed problems with highlighting URLs that contain a tilde ('~').
	-	many more bugfixes

v0.903, 2002-02-22
	-	Beam no longer complains about unknown prefs-field 'BeMailStyle'.

v0.902, 2002-02-22
	-	removed crashing bug when wildly moving through mailfolder-view.
	-	disabled selecting and invoking for	the dummy-mailrefview used in prefs.
	-	make the reply-mode with selected text work (only selected text will be
		included in reply).

v0.901, 2002-02-21
	-	enable people to send mail if there is no working name-service
		(Beam used to complain that it could not determine own hostname).
		In this case, Beam now uses host/domain info from network settings-file.
													[thx to the many people who reported this]
	-	preferences window is now moved to front when a user tries to open it twice
		(instead of crashing, as before).
	-	recreating a mailfolder-cache now works.
	-	new prefs-flag that selects BeMail-compatible shortcuts.
	-	when a new node has been detected and seems to have zero size, we assume
		that an application is creating the mail-file directly inside the in-folder.
		In this case, we snooze for a short amount of time and then proceed to
		read the file, which hopefully is now completely written.
		This is no complete solution, but I hope that this will increase 
		compatibility with MailDaemonReplacement and other programs.
	-	fixed a couple of smaller redraw/layout issues

v0.90, 2002-02-19
	- first public release
