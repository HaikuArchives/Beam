[Beam 1.0-rc7]
*******************************************************************************

< 2003-11-12: commit>

BmBodyPartList, BmEncoding, BmMailHeader:
	-	fixed bug with illegal characters being able to slip into encoded
		mail-headers, some of which do indeed confuse mail-servers and
		cause mails to be garbled. 
		Now we avoid any of <>:;()[]\ to be included in mail-headers in
		an unencoded form.
	-	fixed possible encoding of References- and In-Reply-To-fields
		although encoding is forbidden within these fields.

BmEncoding:
	-	added Finalize() to Utf8Decoder, where give iconv the opportunity
		to add a final shift-sequence if needed (e.g. for iso-2022-jp).
	-	added support for automatically suppressing conversion errors if
		(and only if) all that is missing is the final shift-sequence.
		This "error" happens a lot because of several MUAs (Beam included)
		not doing iso-2022-jp conversion *quite* right.

BmJobStatusWin:
	-	improved checking for active jobs such that inactive (but visible)
		jobs no longer trigger the alert.

BmPrefsMailConstrView:
	-	made the two settings 'AddPeopleNameToMailAddr' and 
		'LookForPeopleInPeopleFolder' actually work.

EncodedWordEncoderTest:
	-	changed results to comply with new encoding rules.

*******************************************************************************
[Beam 1.0-rc6]
*******************************************************************************

< 2003-11-10: commit>

BmApp:
	-	fixed handling of 'mailto:'-URLs.
	-	added missing foreign-key from filters to identity-list.
	-	fixed possible crash during printing of mails.
	-	before quitting, we now check if there are still jobs active

BmBodyPartList:
	-	fixed bug that would not accept an empty first line within
		a mimepart as representing an empty mimepart-header.

BmDataModel, BmMenuController:
	-	added support to list-models for automatically telling interested
		menu-controllers about any occuring changes. This fixes the
		problem of the network-menu-items' shortcuts not working unless
		the menu was being shown on-screen.

BmJobStatusWin:
	-	added HasActiveJobs()

BmListController, BmController, BmMailFolderView:
	-	changed several methods from public to protected.

mLogWindow:
	-	we now avoid automatic workspace-activation if shown.

BmMail:
	-	added field 'X-List' to the list-indicators.
	-	fixed bug in quoting-code that caused Beam to freeze if a '|'
		was part of the quoting-phrase.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	we now update the identity, too, if the mail is being saved.

BmMailHeader:
	-	we no longer write Resent-fields into the mail-attributes, since
		that seems just confusing.
	-	in DetermineListAddress() we now look into Resent-fields for the
		list-address, this way Beam is able to correctly reply to the
		list if the mail has been redirected to the list.

BmMailRefView:
	-	made automatic selection of next mail after a delete optional.

BmMailView:
	-	disallowed the chars '&' and '=' to end a line since they are
		common in URLs which we do not want to word-wrap.
	-	added IsDisplayComplete() - method to facilitate printing of mails.

BmMenuController:
	-	added automatic adding/removing to/from listmodel's set of parties
		interested in changes.

BmPrefsMailReadView:
	-	added option for automatic selection of next mail after a delete.

BmPrefsReccvMailView:
	-	corrected ESC-shortcut of remove-account alert.

BmRulerView:
	-	we now avoid setting the position to anything less than one.

BmSmtp:
	-	fixed bug with missing "\r\n" when generating bcc-header.
	-	fixed problem with logging of msg-header not working properly.

BmString:
	-	added checks for memory-allocation failure
	-	fixed MoveInto() to handle oversized requests more gracefully
	    (more DWIM).
	    
StringTest:
	-	added tests for low-memory situations.

web/
	-	updated info to Beam 1.0

*******************************************************************************
[Beam 1.0-rc5]
*******************************************************************************

< 2003-10-21: commit>

BmApp:
	-	simplified handling of BMM_TRASH.

BmMailRefView, BmMainWindow:
	-	unified handling of different trash-shortcuts (DEL, CTRL-T,
		menu and toolbar) such that Beam now does the same no matter
		which shortcut you use.

BmMemIO:
	-	removed unneeded #includes

< 2003-10-20: commit>

BmApp, BmDataModel, BmMainWindow:
	-	removed awkward special-casing of job-done messages being
		routed through the app just to inform the main-window when
		the popaccount-list has been read. Must have been a bad
		day at the time...

BmBodyPartList, BmEncoding:
	-	extended NeedsEncoding() to support different line-lengths
		when determining overlong lines (for header and body).

BmMail:
	-	changed AddQuotedText() to be more efficient for very long
		paragraphs.

libregexx:
	- fixed compilation issue if using C-mode.

< 2003-10-16: commit>

BmPrefsRecvMailView:
	-	fixed bug that caused DeleteMailFromServer-setting to not work
		anymore (and nobody noticed for weeks, tsk!).

makefiles:
	-	patched makesystem to work on PPC, too.

many files:
	-	fixed compilation issues on PPC

< 2003-10-13: commit>

BmBodyPartList:
	-	changed check for discarded characters when converting to/from
		UTF-8.

BmEncoding:
	-	we now consistently discard chars that are illegal for a specific
		encoding and keep track of the first discarded position.
	-	in NeedsEncoding() we no demand encoding if the text contains
		lines that exceed the length of 998 octets (see RFC2822).

BmLogWindow:
	-	we no longer show error-window if in testmode.

BmMailView:
	-	instead of requiring hard-breaks of lines exceeding 998 octets,
		we now demand qp-encoding of the mail-text instead. This avoids
		the insertion of unwanted newlines into very long paragraphs.

BmPrefsView, BmPrefs...View, BmPrefsWin:
	-	when activating a specific prefs-view automatically, we now take 
		care to select the activated view in the prefs-listview, too.

BmPrefs, BmRulerView:
	-	changed from prefs-setting 'MaxLineLenForHardWrap' to 
		'NeverExceed78Chars'.

src-tests:
	-	updated tests to current state of BmEncoding
	-	added remaining tests so that encoding/decoding is now complete.

WrappingTextView:
	-	we now ignore B_COPY-messges if the selection is empty. This way
		we no longer clobber an existing selection when the user presses
		CTRL-C instead of CTRL-V.

< 2003-10-10: commit>

BmBodyPartList, BmEncoding:
	-	added support for automatic replacement of charset 'unknown-8bit'
		(added by some servers during conversion) with default-charset.

BmDataModel:
	-	ThreadStartFunc() no longer throws, thus avoiding terminate().

BmMail:
	-	fixed bug with personal-reply-phrase ("you") not working.

BmMailHeader:
	-	file now follows the 80-chars-per-line rule.

BmNetUtil:
	-	fixed bug in IsPPPRunning() under BONE which would cause Beam to
		run out of file-descriptors. No good!

< 2003-10-09: commit>

BmApp:
	-	added log-entries when a pop-account wants to check mail (such 
		that it is clear whether the check is being executed or not).

BmBasics:
	-	added global flag BeamOnDano that indicates whether or not Beam
		is currently running an Dano (or later).

BmFilter:
	-	fixed crash when taking along older filter-settings (only vague
		chance this ever happens in the outside world, but it did for me).

BmLogHandler:
	-	made mActiveLogs private

BmLogWindow
	-	positions of log-windows are now persistent.
	-	made error-window cling to bottom of main-window.

BmMainWindow:
	-	made error-window cling to bottom of main-window.
	-	now we correctly add all entries to log-menu.

BmMenuControl:
	-	changed Dano-compatibility from a compile-time-switch to
		a run-time switch. This way the bone-release should look alright
		under Dano, too.

BmPrefsRecvMailView:
	-	added minor fix to redrawing of days-label.

< 2003-10-07: commit>

BmBodyPartList:
	-	fixed crashing bug with empty bodyparts not being handled 
		correctly. When looking for the end of a bodypart's header, 
		we now make sure to not accept any separator-lines that are not 
		part of the current bodypart.

ColumnListView:
	-	fixed bug with items not being added to the end of the superitem's
		children list if the listview is hierarchical and does not have
		any sorting order. 
		This caused the bodypart-view to be upside-down (last item first).

many files:
	-	changed usage of BM_THROW...-macros to comply with the 
		80-chars-per-line rule.

*******************************************************************************
[Beam 1.0-rc4]
*******************************************************************************

< 2003-10-05: commit>

BmBasics:
	-	added context-parameter to BM_text_error

BmBodyPartList:
	-	added empty context-parameter when using BM_text_error.

BmEncoding:
	-	added us-ascii to charsets.
	-	added check for conversion errors when converting header-
		contents from UTF-8 to destination charset.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	now handles conversion-errors for header-fields, too (not just
		for mail-text and attachments).

BmMailHeader:
	-	ConstructRawText() now throws a BM_text_error if the conversion
		of one of the header-field contents to it's destination charset
		failed.

BmMainWindow:
	-	changed shortcuts for network-menu to be in the same order as
		on the keyboard (1234567890 instead if 0123456789).

BmPrefs:
	-	added 'us-ascii' to the frequently used charsets.

< 2003-10-02: commit>

BmApp, TestBeam:
	-	improved startup-snychronisation between Beam and its testing
		thread (synchronization is now two-way).

BmJobStatusWin, BmNetJobModel:
	-	reworked according to 80-chars-per-line rule.

BmPopAccount:
	-	removed unneded include of BmPopper.h

BmPrefsMailReadView, BmPrefsRecvMailView:
	-	moved check-only-if-PPP-is-up-setting to POP-accounts page
		since too many people have had problems finding it where it
		used to live.

BmPrefs:
	-	removed unneded setting of mailbox-path for testmode.

BmSmtp:
	-	fixed crash in StateAuthThroughPopServer() if only checking
		for supported authentication-types.
	-	checking for authentication-types works again.

QuotedPrintableEncoderTest:
	-	even more tests for encoded-word encoding (now with different
		charset).

< 2003-09-30: commit>

BmMailEditWin, BmMenuControl, BmSieveFilter, BmTextControl:
	-	established a layout that is consistent between R5 and Dano.

BmMenuControllerBase, BmPrefsIdentityView, BmPrefsRecvMailView:
	-	fixed minor problem with mark not always being set properly.

BmSignature:
	-	made sure to convert-charsets to lowercase

QuotedPrintableEncoderTest:
	-	added some more tests for problematic encoded-word encoding.

< 2003-09-29: commit>

BmMail, BmMailView:
	-	fixed problem with long-word-handling messing up formatting of
		asian text (that do not contain spaces and such appear as very 
		long words). Now Beam explicitly checks for URLs and only keeps
		those intact.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	convinced detail-buttons to work more reliably (not just every
		second time...).

WrappingTextView:
	-	increased length of nLongLine-constant to make sense for asian
		(very long) words, too.

< 2003-09-29: commit>

BmEncoding:
	-	changed BmQpEncodedWordEncoder in such a way that it does the
		character conversion (from utf-8 to the destination charset), too.
		This should finally deal properly with the problem of not being
		allowed to separate a multibyte-char across two encoded words.
		RFC2047 is a nightmare...
	-	made utf-8 encoding/decoding more robust against illegal multibyte
		sequences.

BmPrefsGeneralView:
	-	fixed a typo and worked towards 80-chars-per-line.

BmSmtp:
	-	if a send-job is stopped, it no longer marks the current mail as
		sent (it leaves it alone instead).

QuotedPrintableEncoderTest:
	-	added more tests for BmQpEncodedWordEncoder.


*******************************************************************************
[Beam 1.0-rc3]
*******************************************************************************

BmPrefsFilterChainView:
	-	'Pos'-column is now again hidden properly
	-	cleaned source to follow 80-chars-per-line

BmUtil:
	-	improved robustness of ParseDateTime() with respect to dates
		containing textual timezones that parsedate() doesn't know about.

< 2003-09-23: commit>

BmApp:
	-	some minor changes to support testing.
	-	corrected homepage-url to point to sourceforge.
	-	in QuitRequested(), we now lock each window before calling
		its QuitRequested(), avoiding calls to the debugger.

BmEncoding:
	-	minor fixes in BmBase64Decoder, BmQuotedPrintableEncoder and
		BmFoldedLineEncoder. All these should strictly follow RFCs, now!

BmFilterChain:
	-	sorted map of filters inside a chain is now updated when an
		item is added, not only when one is removed.

BmIdentity:
	-	In HandlesAddrSpec(), we no longer return true if given an
		empty addrSpec. When replying to mailing-lists, this could 
		result in the From:-header being randomly chosen from the
		mail being replied too (ieek!).

BmMail:
	-	A small change increasing robustness towards incomplete setups.

BmPrefsRecvMailView:
	-	delete-mail-delay-textview is now enabled/disabled as needed.

BmMemIO:
	-	added new class BmRingBuf, which implements a ring-buffer
		(no more need to use BmString for that purpose).

BmString:
	-	fixed a hanging-bug in ReplaceSet().
	-	fixed incorrect handling of %%-sequence in DeUrlify().
	-	added tests (openbeos and own) for automated testing.

src-tests:
	-	added tests for BmBase (BmString and BmMemIO-classes).
	-	added tests for base64-encoding & -decoding as well as tests
		for FoldedLineEncoder.

several files:
	-	more cleanups concerning the 80-chars-per-line rule.

< 2003-09-15: commit>

BmApp, BmBasics:
	-	added support for testmode

BmBodyPartList:
	-	finished support for handling text-attachments as utf-8 or
		as being of the charset currently selected in edit-window.
	-	fixed minor problem with pending \r\n being included in the
		bodypart, when in fact it shouldn't (since it is just there
		to separate the bodypart from the boundary).

BmBodyPartView:
	-	finished support for handling text-attachments as utf-8 or
		as being of the charset currently selected in edit-window.
	-	added missing support for dragging from one bodypartview to
		another one.

BmEncoding:
	-	corrected a couple of bugs in BmQuotedPrintableDecoder.
		Hey, automated testing pays off already!

BmLogHandler, BmLogWindow:
	-	added support for automatically bringing up the error-window
		if an error occurs (and no alerts should be shown).
	-	made the relation between log-files and log-windows a bit
		more flexible.

BmMail:
	-	finished support for handling text-attachments as utf-8 or
		as being of the charset currently selected in edit-window.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	finished support for handling text-attachments as utf-8 or
		as being of the charset currently selected in edit-window.

BmPopAccount, BmSmtpAccount, BmPopper:
	-	logfiles are no longer created statically one for each account.
		Instead they are created when needed.

BmPrefs, BmPrefsGeneralView:
	-	changed default for 'ShowAlertForErrors'-setting from true 
		to false.

BmPrefsMailConstrView:
	-	added control for "ImportExportTextAsUtf8"-setting.

BmResources:
	-	added support for testmode

several files:
	-	changed many occurrences of BM_LOGERR to BM_SHOWERR, since
		this now will only pop-up the error-window instead of showing
		an alert.

makefiles:
	-	finally cleaned up things so that Beam compiles on "normal"
		BeOS-pcs. It compiles under R5 x86, BONE and Dano, 
		but not PPC yet.

src-tests:
	-	added TestBeam to CVS currently with tests for 
		BmQuotedPrintableDecoder only, but there's more to come.

< 2003-09-13: commit>

BmFilterChain, BmIdentity, BmPopAccount, BmSmtpAccount:
	-	fixed race-condition/crash in ForeignKeyChanged().

BmNetJobModel, BmPopper, BmSmtp:
	-	cleanup of net-related include-files.

< 2003-09-12: commit>

BmEncoding:
	-	fixed problem with encoded-words being over-ambitious in digesting
		whitespace. Now only whitespace between encoded-words is dumped
		(whitespace between encoded-word and normal header-text stays
		intact).

BmMail, BmMailFilter:
	-	rewrote move-to-tash functionality.

BmPopAccount, BmSmtpAccount:
	-	fixed signedness-related warning.

BmPrefsLoggingView:
	-	corrected minimum width of menus on the left to actually fit
		'Log Everything'.

pcre:
	-	upgraded to version 4.4

libSieve:
	-	fixed a load of warnings.

makefiles:
	-	readjusted so that Beam compiles cleanly (no warnings) while
		sacrificing as few warnings as possible.

*******************************************************************************
[Beam 1.0-rc2]
*******************************************************************************

< 2003-09-11: commit>

BmApp, BmMainWindow, BmMailRefView, BmMailViewWin, BmPrefs:
	-	added support for 'Edit As New...'-functionality.

BmMail:
	-	improved detection of identity for incoming mails:
		when we have determined the default-identity for the 
		given pop-account, we now proceed to check if there's
		another identity that corresponds directly to the
		receiving address of the current mail.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	now archives/restores state of detail-buttons, too.

BmMenuControllerBase:
	-	now keeps the marked item even for menus which do not
		have the BM_MC_LABEL_FROM_MARKED-flag set.

BmPrefs:
	-	switch loglevels from int16 to int32
	-	removed multiple entries for 'DefaultCharset'

BmTextControl:
	-	now uses BmMenuControllerBase as Menu

< 2003-09-09: commit>

BmMenuControllerBase:
	-	added as base class for BmMenuController, which allows us
		to use simple menu-controllers in add-ons (like SIEVE).

BmSieveFilter:
	-	implemented folder- and identity-menu by means of
		BmMenuControllerBase, ensuring that these menues are
		always up to date.

< 2003-09-08: commit>

many files:
	-	replaced most #defines by something more c++-like.
	-	tried hard to comply better with the 80-chars-per-line rule.

BmApp:
	-	added support for joining multiple replies into one single
		mail, no matter what the original recipients were.

BmBodyPartView:
	-	added support for removing attachments from mails that are
		being read (not edited).

BmDataModel:
	-	RenameItem() now takes the oldKey by-value such that is not changed
		during the rename-operation.
	-	added support for appended archives, which are being written
		while Beam is running and integrated into the current archive
		upon Store() or on startup-after-crash.

BmDeskbarView:
	-	now we avoid dealing with new mails living in Trash since other
		mail-clients might put them there with status=='New'. We no
		longer care about those.

BmEncoding:
	-	fixed problem in BmFoldedLineEncoder that would always
		lead to hard-break formatting.

BmLogWindow:
	-	cosmetical changes: smaller tab, fixed font.

BmMail:
	-	corrected a small problem in DetermineReplyAddress() with respect
		to the setting of replyToPersonOnly.

BmMailFilter:
	-	now we (again) do stop processing the filter chain if a matching
		filter has requested so.

BmMainWindow:
	-	convinced the pop-accounts menu to automagically be updated
		when the PopAccountlist is set-up in order to make the menu
		shortcuts work at all times (not only after you opened the
		menu for the first time).

BmMenuController:
	-	simplified and polished, works more reliably now.

BmPopAccount:
	-	added missing initialization for mHomeFolder.
	-	changed UID-handling, esp. we no write UIDs of downloaded mails
		immediately, so that after a crash Beam should now only double
		download a maximum of one mail only.

BmPopper:
	-	added support for removing mails from server after a given 
		number of days.
	-	added support for removing local UIDs that are not any longer
		listed on the server (saves _loads_ of space, my PopAccounts-file
		has gone from 128KB to 3KB...)

BmPrefsFilterChainView:
	-	replaced non-working MoveUp/MoveDown-buttons by drag'n'drop.

BmPrefsIdentityView:
	-	corrected heading.

BmPrefsMailConstrView:
	-	fixed bug with default-charset not being saved.

BmPrefsRecvMailView:
	-	added support for automatically removing the corresponding 
		identities when an account is removed.

BmPrefsWin:
	-	upon startup, we now show the 'General' - page.

BmString:
	-	fixed embarrassing bug in Trim(), which caused havoc in mail-
		header generation when editing mails.

BmUtil:
	-	corrected one-hour offset in date when converting to internet
		time, which could lead to wrong date being displayed.

ColumnListView:
	-	fixed bug when sorting items at the end of a hierarchical
		listview which has "pending children".

makefiles/:
	-	added the make-system that has kindly been provided by
		Linus Almstrom.

< 2003-08-21: commit>

BmBodyPartList:
	-	added WriteToFile() as support for new drag-protocol.

BmBodyPartView:
	-	upgraded dragging-protocol to actually make use of the
		notification message.

BmEncoding:
	-	fixed case-related problem in charset-conversion that could lead
		to a hang.
	-	Fixed problem with Beam sometimes violating RFC2047	in such a way 
	    that it was possible to separate a multibyte-char across two 
	    encoded-words. This is no longer the case (I hope).

BmMail:
	-	write missing MAIL:-attributes to file (e.g. MAIL:recipients 
		and MAIL:flags).

BmMailHeader:
	-	fixed cache-validation bug in BmAddrList, which resulted in
		outdated mAddrString-contents being returned by AddrString().

BmMailRefView:
	-	added checking of be:originator when handling B_TRASH_TARGET.

BmMemIO:
	-	in BmMemFilter::Read(), we no longer Finalize() the filter
		if the dest-buffer is to small and just has to be grown.

*******************************************************************************
[Beam 1.0-rc1]

	summary:
		-	added detailed logging of mail-filtering
		-	brought prefs up-to-date, including possibility to influence logging
		-	startup feels faster now (window is shown sooner)
		-	on startup, we now block mail-checking until pop-accounts are complete.
		-	several smaller bugs fixed
*******************************************************************************

< 2003-08-09: commit>

BmEncoding, BmPrefs, BmPrefsMailConstrView:
	-	fixed a couple of case-inconsistencies.

BmLogHandler:
	-	replaced parameter-nam "flag" by the more appropriate "terrain".

BmLogWindow:
	-	now always use B_TITLED_WINDOW_LOOK, otherwise the scrollbar's
		lower button is not visible.

BmMailFilter, BmSieveFilter:
	-	added (more detailed) logging.

BmMailFolderView:
	-	in InOutAlwaysAtTop-mode, we now move the drafts folder to the
		top, too.

BmPrefsGeneralView:
	-	added prefs-item ShowToolbarBorder.

BmPrefsLogging:
	-	added this prefs-view.

BmPrefsWin:
	-	added logging-prefs-view.

< 2003-08-07: commit>

BmApp:
	-	before checking mail, we now check if all pop-accounts have been
		read and, if not, we wait until they are.

BmMailView:
	-	small modification concerning the prefs-item UndoMode.

BmPrefs:
	-	added new prefs-items to default-msg.

BmPrefsGeneralView:
	-	added the prefs-items ShowToolbarLabel, ShowToolbarIcons,
		ShowAlertForErrors and CloseViewWin.

BmPrefsMailConstrView:
	-	added support for selecting the frequently used character-sets.
	-	added the prefs-items UndoMode, ReplyIntroStrPrivate, 
		AddNameToPeople, PeopleFolder and LookInPeopleFolder.

BmPrefsMailReadView:
	-	added the prefs-items ShowDecodedLength, UseSwatchTimeInRefView
		and TimeModeInHeaderView.

BmPrefsWin:
	-	changed minimum size in such a way that filter-page is always
		displayed correctly.

< 2003-08-05: commit>

BmApp:
	-	in ReplyToMails() we now use the information if a mail goes
		to a person only in order to correctly set the reply-intro
		under all circumstances.

BmBodyPartView:
	-	changed (again) the way how Beam complains when an attachment's
		declared mimetype does not match its real one. Now we explicitly
		check if message/rfc822 has been detected as text/... and in that
		case automatically insist on open this attachment as a mail.

BmEncoding:
	-	added automatic correction from "utf8" to "utf-8" when converting
		from/to UTF-8.

BmGuiUtil:
	-	small optimization in AddCharsetMenu().

BmLogHandler:
	-	fixed problems with new BM_LOG-macros: they were not properly
		surrounded by a statement block, which lead to unwanted changes
		of code-grammar (if-else structures were being corrupted).

BmMail:
	-	in CreateReply(), AddPartsFromMail() and CreateReplyIntro() 
		we now use the information if a mail goes to a person only 
		in order to correctly set the reply-intro under all circumstances.
	-	in HasComeFromList(), we now look at the mail-field Mailing-List,
		too.

BmMailHeader:
	-	in DetermineReplyAddress(), we now look at the mail-field 
		Mail-Followup-To, too.
	-	in DetermineOriginator(), we now look at the mail-field 
		Mail-Reply-To, too.

BmMailRefView, BmPrefs:
	-	changed menu-entry from "Reply To Originator" to "Reply To Person".

BmMainWindow, BmLogWindow, BmMailEditWin, BmMailViewWin:
	-	changed default for Prefs-value 'UseDocumentResizer' to true.

BmWindow:
	-	added code to ensure that windows are always opened on-screen.

< 2003-08-02: commit>

BmApp:
	-	added some more logging to startup-phase.
	-	restructured startup phase to feel faster.

BmMailFolderList:
	-	corrected counting of folders for logging.

BmMailHeader:
	-	fixed bug in unfolding-regex: spaces at the end of the line
		were not matched (but they should be). Now Beam should always
		separate two unfolded lines by exactly one space.

BmMailRefList, BmListController:
	-	deactivated logging of estimated object sizes (useful for debugging,
	    but no more needed).

BmLogHandler:
	-	optimized and cleaned-up logging to such an extent that the
		string to be logged is only created if current loglevels suffice.
		These preparations were needed in order to allow logging in
		release-versions of Beam.
	-	finished support for passing log-messages on to log-windows.
	
BmLogWindow:
	-	added (replaced BmLogView), a simple way to view logs.

BmPopper:
	-	in destructor, we no longer finish the corresponding log. Since
		the logs now live on, they can be selected in the 'Show Log'-menu,
		which is what we want.

BmString:
	-	added Trim()

many files:
	-	checked and corrected logging where appropriate.



*******************************************************************************
[Beam test-03-07-28]

	summary:
		-	Graphical editor for Mail-filters has been sexed up a bit.
		-	Mail-filters can be created from a given mail (From, To
		   and Subject will be set).
		-	When adding filters, you can now ask Beam to automatically
		   add them to the default chain.
		-	several bugs fixed
*******************************************************************************

< 2003-07-28: release test-03-07-28 >

BmFilterAddon:
	-	added SetupFromMailData() that creates some filter-lines according
		to the given mail-data.

BmApp, BmMailViewWin, BmMainWindow, BmMsgTypes:
	-	added BMM_CREATE_FILTER

BmMailRef:
	-	corrected a comment
	
BmMailRefView:
	-	added menu-entry to create a filter from (first) selected mail.

BmMultiLineTextControl:
	-	corrected layout concerning the divider-position.

BmPrefsFilterChainView:
	-	added a minimum size to hgroup containing filter-chain listview.
	-	removed some layout-glitches.

BmPrefsFilterView:
	-	added check-button that allows to automatically add new filters to
		the default chain, too.
	-	added support for creating filters from a given mail

BmPrefsView, BmPrefsWin:
	-	added support for jumping to a specific prefsview and send it a
		message (asking it to do something)

BmSieveFilter:
	-	made menu-controls of filter-line top-aligned.
	-	moved values-control closer to operator-control.
	-	HACKED a way around a weird BScrollView-problem which causes
		problems when resizing a view that is scrolled downwards.
	-	added support for creating filter from mail-data.

ColumnListView:
	-	removed return-value checking from Unarchive(), since it caused
		problems when trying to read from older state-archives.

ImageAboutWindow:
	-	added B_NOT_ZOOMABLE to window's flags.

MultiLineTextControl:
	-	fixed crash if given label is NULL.

< 2003-07-26: commit>

BmBasics:
	-	fixed two bugs introduced during restructuring work: BM_network_error
		and BM_text_error are now (again) derived from BM_runtime_error, not
		BM_error.
		
BmJobStatusWin:
	-	added stop-button to BmMailMoverJob.

BmMailFilter, BmMailMover:
	-	now we say "stopped!" if job has been stopped.
	
BmMailViewWin:
	-	we now close the window automatically after a reply has been 
		requested (depending on prefs).

BmMenuControl:
	-	added support for specifying a text at construction time, which
		will be used to determine the exact width of the menufield.
	-	corrected incorrect layout if divider < 12

BmMultiLineTextControl:
	-	minor cleanup, moved MView-related methods from private to
		public in order to be able to use them from external classes.

BmPrefsFilterView:
	-	adjusted default layout of splitter

BmSieveFilter:
	-	added support for SIEVE's address-test, allowing to specify which
		part of an address field to use for a match
	-	added support for multiple values, which can now be entered in
		a corresponding multiline-textfield.
	-	added BmFilterScrollView, a scrollview that works as required by
		the filter-list. Now the maximum number of filter-lines is 
		(arbitrarily) set to 20. That should be enough, I hope.

BmTextControl:
	-	corrected incorrect layout if divider < 12

BmToolbarButton:
	-	now we make sure never to display a context-menu if the button
		does not need a latch (has no subitems).

ColumnListView:
	-	fixed bug that would allow extending the selection by use of
		cursor-down key although the listview is in single-select mode.

MultiLineTextControl:
	-	changed text-margin from 4 to 3 pixels.

< 2003-07-23: commit>

BmApp:
	-	added code to setup the foreign-key connections between the
		different listmodels.

BmDataModel:
	-	added support for automatic handling of foreign-keys, allowing
		Beam to track listmodel-items referencing other listmodel-items
		to update their record if the referenced item is being renamed.

BmFilter:
	-	implemented ForeignKeyChanged() in order to automatically update
		foreign-keys (call is double-dispatched to add-on).

BmFilterAddon:
	-	added identifiers for the foreign-key folder and identity
	-	added abstract ForeignKeyChanged()-base method

BmFilterChain:
	-	added methods for removing a filter from one/all chain(s).
	-	added methods for renaming a filter in one/all chain(s).

BmIdentity:
	-	implemented ForeignKeyChanged() in order to automatically update
		foreign-keys.

BmMailFolder, BmMailFolderList:
	-	implemented automatic updating of foreign-keys to folder-name.

BmMailRefView:
	-	added identity - column to listview

BmMailView:
	-	when adding signature to empty mailtext, we now always make sure
		to insert an empty line before the signature. Without this, 
		the complete mailtext would be grey.

BmMenuControl:
	-	fixed crash in MarkItem() when an item was not found in recurse 
		mode.

BmPeople:
	-	added support for using full mail-address in addition to just
		using the addrSpec.

BmPopAccount:
	-	implemented ForeignKeyChanged() in order to automatically update
		foreign-keys.

BmPrefs:
	-	fixed bug with archive-version not being updated correctly, which
		in turn caused the item "DefaultCharset" being added every time
		the prefs were saved.

BmPrefsFilterView:
	-	fixed sorting of filters (now we *do* set a sortkey...).
	-	when renaming a filter, we now adjust the link in all chains
		that use this filter.
	-	when removing a filter, we now remove the link from all chains
		that used this filter.

BmPrefsFilterChainView:
	-	fixed sorting of chained items (now we sort numerically).
	-	when renaming a chain, we now adjust the link in all pop-accounts
		that use this chain.

BmSieveFilter:
	-	implemented ForeignKeyChanged() in order to automatically update
		foreign-keys.

BmSmtpAccount:
	-	implemented ForeignKeyChanged() in order to automatically update
		foreign-keys.

< 2003-07-16: commit>

BmFilter:
	-	corrected bug that would cause Beam to create wrong kind of
		Sieve-filter when trying to migrate older archive versions.

BmFilterChain:
	-	fixed crash when removing a filter from the chain (the STL is
		a bit tricky sometimes...)

BmMailEditWin:
	-	BmPeopleControl now detaches from model as itself gets detached
		from window. This fixes the bug with BmPeopleList being unable
		to send messages to detached view ("bad port id").

BmSieveFilter:
	-	added "List-Id" to list of standard-fields.

BmStorageUtil:
	-	in EnsureIndexExists(), we now check if index exists instead
		of always trying to create it, avoiding irrelevant error-logs.

script.c (libSieve):
	-	re-added changes that were lost during my last cvs-havoc. Without
		these changes a script could only be used once.

*******************************************************************************
[Beam test-03-07-15]

	summary:
		-	Mail-filters are now implemented as add-ons.
		-	Mail-filters can be edited in a graphical way, so that it
		   is no longer neccessary (but possible) to edit the SIEVE-script.
		-	Filters can (and have to) be grouped into filter-chains, which
			are associated to specific accounts.
		-	Beam now provides full support for mail-identities, making it
			easier to handle many different mail-accounts.
		-	
*******************************************************************************

< 2003-07-15: release test-03-07-15 >

Changes.txt, ToDo.txt:
	-	updated for release test-03-07-15

updateLibFolder.sh:
	-	now we recreate every link by use of -f flag.

BmFilter:
	-	we now expect our add-ons in add-on folder relative to
		Beam's path.

BmFilterAddon, BmMailFilter, BmSieveFilter:
	-	finished implementing SetStatus- and Discard-functionalities-

BmIdentity:
	-	fixed crash when trying to archive an identity-list that has
		no current identity.

BmMail:
	-	implemented storing of mails into Trash.

BmPrefsFilterChainView:
	-	removed glitch with chainview not always appearing.

< 2003-07-13: commit >

- structural changes
- finished implementing SIEVE as addon
- added GUI-prefs for SIEVE-filters
- added full support for mail-identities

< 2003-04-22: commit >

BmApp:
	-	added support for moving mails into a specific folder (this time
		not by drag'n'drop but through use of a context-menu).

BmBodyPartList
	-	replaced calls to GetStrippedFieldVal() with GetFieldVal()
	-	improved handling of errors during text-conversion

BmDataModel:
	-	added DisplayKey() to BmListModelItem, this represents a name
		of the item that is being used for display.
	-	in RenameItem() we now avoid doing anything if the old and
		the new name are identical (we used to find a new, unique name
		in this case).

BmEncoding:
	-	added support to UTF8Encoder for automatic discarding of
		illegal char-sequences. This way, chars that could not be
		converted will be missing from the displayed mailtext, but
		the mailtext will not be cut off at the first illegal sequence.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	replaced calls to GetStrippedFieldVal() with GetFieldVal()

BmMailFolder:
	-	added DisplayKey()

BmMailFolderList:
	-	fixed problem with NewMail-query when restarting job-model

BmMailHeader, BmMail:
	-	threw out handling of unstripped headers, now we have only one
		set of headers (the stripped, i.e. parsed version), which makes 
		things clearer and more obvious.

BmMailHeaderView:
	-	now all key-msgs within a header-field-view that concern 
		cursor-movement are propagated to the mailview instead. This
		way you can click on the mail-header and still use the cursor
		keys to navigate the mail-view. Additionally, this avoids
		scrolling away the header-field-view's contents... >:oP
	-	fixed incorrect textrect in content-view of a header-field,
		which would lead to text of long fields being cut off at the
		right edge.
		
BmMailRefView:
	-	added move-to submenu to context-menu

BmMailView:
	-	the separator-chars for undo/redo of the underlying 
		WrappingTextView are now setup according to prefs.

BmMainWindow, BmMailViewWin:
	-	adjusted to new menu-controller conventions
	-	added handling of BMM_MOVE messages

BmMenuController:
	-	reworked code to be of more general use.
	-	added sorting to hierarchical menus.

BmMsgTypes.h:
	-	added BMM_MOVE

BmPopAccount:
	-	in GetDomainName(), we now take into account the possibility
		that the PopServer that has been entered by the user is
		just a domain (no host part). In this case, we no longer cut
		of the first part of the domain, we just return the complete
		string.
	-	integrated NeedControllersToContinue(false)

BmPrefsFilterView, BmPrefsRecvMailView, BmPrefsSendMailView:
	-	fixed annoying reversal-problem when editing the key-field
		(the name).

BmSmtpAccount:
	-	integrated NeedControllersToContinue(false)

BubbleHelper:
	-	added support for central cursor management
	-	upgraded BView-lookup from BList to stl::map

Cursor, CLVColumnLabelView:
	-	switched to R5 cursor-handling (BCursor)

UserResizeSplitView:
	-	fixed problems with incorrect mouse-cursors after drag

WrappingTextView:
	-	added support for word-, sentence-, paragraph-wise undo/redo.

BmMemIO:
	-	added support for resetting a BmStringOBuf.

< 2003-04-10: commit >

BmApp:
	-	now we start mail-reading-jobs only if the mail has not already
		been read from disk. This fixes the annoying behaviour that the
		mailview always scrolls back to top/left when you reply/print/
		forward this mail.

BmDataModel:
	-	added NeedControllersToContinue() which specifies if a
		job-model requires controllers in order to run or not

BmEncoding:
	-	fixed bug leading to endless loop when the only space in a
		header-field is at the beginning.
	-	folding code handles long lines without spaces a bit smarter.

BmMail:
	-	removed superfluous space in first 'References:'-line.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	added support for drag'n'drop of people into the addr-fields.

BmPeople:
	-	added support for live people-queries

< 2003-03-28: commit >

BmApp:
	-	added TheFilterChainList to global init/uninit

BmDataModel:
	-	in RenameItem(), we now pass UPD_SORT to TellModelItemUpdated(),
		such that the View has a chance to re-sort the items.

BmFilter, BmJobStatusWin, BmMailFilter, BmMailRefView, BmMailViewWin,
BmMainWindow, BmPopAccount, BmPopper, BmPrefsFilterView, 
BmPrefsRecvMailView, BmPrefsWin:
	-	switched from inbound/outbound filter-lists to a single
		list of filters that is associated to accounts by the 
		newly introduced filter-chains. 
		I believe this represents a good compromise between flexibility
		and ease-of-setup.

BmFilterChain:
	-	file added, implements BmFilterChain, BmFilterChainList and 
		BmChainedFilter

BmLogHandler:
	-	fixed bug with log-files not quitting when they should

BmMailHeader:
	-	made BmRefObj virtual in BmMailHeader

BmPeople:
	-	added email-attribute to people-query (this fixes the problem
		of people with empty names not being shown).
	-	corrected handling of foreign people

BmPrefs:
	-	adjusted default shortcuts

BmPrefsFilterChainView:
	-	added file, implements filter-chain administration

BmResources:
	-	we now remove all whitespace from FQDN, just to be sure

BmTextControl:
	-	added missing include for MenuField.h

< 2003-03-12: commit >

BmEncoding:
	-	fixed bug with incorrect return-code expectations when calling
		iconv_open()

BmRefManager:
	-	fixed serious bug that showed when using virtual BmRefObj
		base classes. The bug itself being a cast from void* to 
		BmRefObj which just does not work for virtual base classes.

< 2003-03-04: commit >

BmBodyPartList:
	-	removed visit to debugger in SetTo() when trying to call 
		AddSubItem() without having the model locked. Now we lock it.

< 2003-03-04: commit >

all files:
	-	checked and tightened use of free pointers / ref-objects
	-	checked and tightened locking mechanism, esp. trying to avoid
		the problematic situation when a thread tries to lock a model
		while it already holds the GlobalLock. This situation now 
		triggers the debugger.
	-	added quite some more BM_ASSERTs into devel-build in order to
		drop into the debugger whenever something insane is going on.

BmBodyPartList:
	-	by default, if a bodypart doesn't contain any charset-specification
		in its content-type, we now use the DefaultEncoding instead of
		us-ascii. Since this doesn't conform to RFC822, this can be
		changed by prefs.

BmPopAccount, BmSmtpAccount:
	-	removed superfluous filter-member

BmPrefsRecvMailView, BmPrefsSendMailView:
	-	removed superfluous filter-control

BmUtil:
	-	fixed char-count/byte-count confusion in WordWrap() which would
		lead to unreasonably short lines with 2-byte encodings.

< 2003-02-26: commit >

BmApp:
	-	juggled order of object-creation so that prefs are created
		a bit sooner (since we now need them for logfile-truncation).

BmListController:
	-	fixed bug in RemoveModelItem() that would simply ignore any
		items contained within the item to be removed. Now these
		items will be removed, too. This removes a ref-leak.

BmLogHandler:
	-	added support for logfile-truncation

BmMailFolderList:
	-	simplified and bug-fixed node-monitoring code somewhat

BmMailFolderView:
	-	removed UpdateModelItem() specialization, because this is
		now handled in super-class

BmPrefs:
	-	we now ensure that ThePrefs is initialized at the very start
		of constructor

BmRefManager:
	-	minor cleanup of logging-texts

< 2003-02-26: commit >

BmDataModel:
	-	added UPD_SORT-flag that indicates the sorting order has changed

BmListController:
	-	added support for automagical renaming of state-files to
		new naming-convention (including the device-no).

BmMailHeader:
	-	minor cleanup

BmFilter, BmJobStatusWin, BmMail, BmMailEditWin, BmMailFilter, 
BmMailRefView, BmMailViewWin, BmMainWindow, BmPopper, BmPrefsFilterView:
	-	reworked filter-handling to provide a sortable list of filters
		(each of which can be active/deactive)

BmPrefsShortcutsView:
	-	fixed bug with columns being right-justified when in fact they
		should be left-justified

BmPrefsMailConstrView, BmPrefsSignatureView:
	-	changed charset-menus to work correctly for all libiconv-charsets

BmMailRefList:
	-	added support for automagical renaming of mailcache-files to
		new naming-convention (including the device-no).

< 2003-02-25: commit >

several files:
	-	instead of using the BeOS-provided encodings (B_..._CONVERSION)
		we now load all available charsets from libiconv.
	-	removed int32-encoding and replaced it with BmString charset.
	-	made naming consistent between charset and encoding: 
		charset always means character-encoding (e.g. ISO-8859-1), 
		while encoding refers to content-transfer-encoding (e.g. base64).

BmApp:
	-	moved opening of prefs-window to this class, since it is now
		being used in several places.

BmListController:
	-	added mapping from model-item to view-item in order to speed
		up linear search in FindViewItemFor()

BmMailEditWin:
	-	added access to prefs-window to menu
	-	completed support for new libiconv-charsets

BmMailFolder, BmMailFolderList, BmMailRef:
	-	made sure to always use node-refs, not just inodes.

BmMailHeaderView:
	-	fixed crash when header contained malformed lines (lines that
		do not start with whitespace, but were missing a colon).

BmMailRefView:
	-	when the user presses DELETE in order to move mails to trash, we
		now immediately remove the items from the listview (the *view*,
		*not* the mailref-list). This gives nicer looks (less flicker) and
		should remove situations where mails were asked to be moved to 
		Tracker more than once, resulting in Tracker complaining about
		such nonsense.

BmMailView:
	-	added message when a mail's textbody could not be converted 
		correctly from the suggested charset into UTF-8

BmMailViewWin:
	-	added access to prefs-window to menu
	-	removed reference to non-existent menu-item "Filter", which
		caused a crash on open

BmString:
	-	added assert()-calls after malloc()/realloc(), just to be sure
		to crash immediately upon memory-problems

ColumnListView:
	-	corrected a bug in scrolldown-with-selection-code where the view
		was (confusingly) shifted when all selected items were already
		visible in the center of the screen.

*******************************************************************************
[Beam test-03-02-17]

	summary:
		-	Beam now uses libiconv for text-conversions instead of the BeOS-native
			functions (since they do not always work reliably).
		-	the behaviour of the prefs window has been overhauled
		-	Beam supports mail-filters through native SIEVE-scripts
			(you have to enter them manually).

*******************************************************************************
< 2003-02-17: commit, 'current'-tag moved >

BmEncoding:
	-	corrected wrong order of iconv_open() params... tsk!

BmMenuController:
	-	added, these were missing from cvs since a couple of days

BmPrefs:
	-	changed defaults of log-levels

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2003-02-16: commit >

BmBasics:
	-	added new BM_text_error exception

BmBodyPartList, BmMailEditWin:
	-	added support for detecting encoding mismatches (when the
		mailtext contains characters that could not be converted to the
		selected encoding). In such a case, we now ask the user to
		check the selected charset or remove the offending character(s).

BmController:
	-	moved IsMsgFromCurrentModel() from protected to public

BmEncoding:
	-	added support for using libiconv for character-conversions, and
		made this mode the default, since the BeOS-provided conversion-
		routines do not always work reliably when they encounter characters
		that are not supported by a specific encoding (resulting in '\0'-
		characters being inserted into the string, which sooner or later 
		leads to complete havoc...).

BmFilter:
	-	removed the unneeded msg-field MSG_FILTER

BmJobStatusWin:
	-	BmMailFilterView now uses BmListModel::MSG_ITEMKEY instead of 
		BmFilter::MSG_FILTER

BmMail:
	-	minor cleanup

BmMailRefView, BmMainWindow, BmMailViewWin:
	-	added support for dynamically changing the filter-menus as
		the filter-list are being edited.

BmMailView:
	-	removed unneccessary include for BmMainWindow

BmPref*View, BmRulerView:
	-	in the view's destructor, we now remove all BubbleHelper-entries,
		so we do not leave entries lying around that might creep up at
		odd places (when an address is reused by another view)

BmMemIO.h:
	-	added getters HadError(), SrcCount() and DestCount()

Beam*.proj:
	-	added libiconv.so to libraries and removed libtextencoding.so and
		libtranslation.so

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2003-02-13: commit >

BmFilter:
	-	added a couple of MSG-field-names used for communication
		between mail-filter model and view.

BmJobStatusWin:
	-	added BmMailFilterView
	-	changed color of status-bar under DANO (so that it doesn't
		match the background color...)

BmMail:
	-	changed mDestFoldername to be a path instead of a BmString
		(and renamed it to mDestFolderpath while doing it). This
		simplifies the task of determining a mail's new home-folder
		somewhat (although it's still something of a mess).

BmMailEditWin:
	-	now uses BmMail::SetDestFoldername()

BmMailFilter:
	-	now we actually read mails from disk before filtering them. This
		avoids crashing a lot >;o)
	-	implemented store-on-change-only for mail-filtering
	-	added new job-specifier BM_EXECUTE_FILTER that executes a
		filter even if no controller is present (as is the case when
		Beam has just downloaded this mail).

BmMailRef:
	-	added newRef-argument to ResyncFromDisk()

BmMailRefView, BmMailViewWin, BmMainWindow:
	-	added support for applying filters to selected mails

BmPopper, BmSmtp:
	-	added check to ShouldContinue() in StateLogin()

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2003-02-08: commit, 'current'-tag moved >

BmCheckControl:
	-	added SetValueSilently(), needed by PrefsViews

BmFilter:
	-	added support for constructing appropriate error-strings

BmMail:
	-	added support for changing a mail's status before it has
		been written to disk (required in order to realize the sieve
		imapflags-actions).

BmMailFilter:
	-	added support for setting mail-flags through sieve's 
		imapflags-actions
		
BmPrefs:
	-	added ResetToDefault()

BmPrefs...View, BmPrefsWin:
	-	fixed several layout-issues
	-	completely overhauled behaviour prefs-window, which now seems to 
		make more sense
	-	added support for restoring defaults

xmalloc:
	-	fixed bug in xstrconcat() with pos not being incremented

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2003-02-07: commit, 'current'-tag moved >

BmApp:
	-	when joining replies/forwards, they are now being joined
		in chronolical order

BmBodyPartView:
	-	we now accept incorrect mimetype-declarations for attachments
		if (and only if) the real mimetype has supertype "text". 
		This makes it possible to quietly open email-attachments 
		('message/rfc822' but BeOS sees them as 'text/x-email').
	-	fixed bug with incorrectly declared attachments of real 
		supertype 'text' always being opened with the declared type.
		Now they are opened with their real type.

BmFilter:
	-	added Execute()-method that (surprise) executes this filter
		in the given message-context
	-	added support for default-filters

BmListController:
	-	fixed bug that caused autoscroll to stop working when the mouse
		had temporarily exited the listview (and re-entered the scrollzone 
		later)
		
BmMail:
	-	added Filter()-method that applies the appropriate mail-filter
		to this mail
	-	fixed bug with mails being incorrectly initialized as inbound
		when in fact they were outbound

BmMailEditWin:
	-	changed SaveMail() to apply mail-filter immediately before send 
		a mail
	-	changed SaveMail() to store draft messages in the 'draft'-folder
	-	whenever we save a mail, we make sure to set its outbound-flag

BmMailFilter:
	-	added struct MsgContext that includes support for deleting the
		header-buffers which are neccessary because of the braindead
		mechanism libSieve uses to access the headers of a mail

BmMailFolderView:
	-	fixed minor bug with name of MailMover-jobs not being unique

BmMailHeader:
	-	added support for accessing all entries for a single header

BmPopAccount, BmSmtpAccount:
	-	added support for handling an account's filtername

BmPopper:
	-	after a mail has been rerieved, we now apply the appropriate
		mail-filter before storing the mail on disk

BmPrefsFilterView:
	-	added support for specifying a default filter (one for inbound 
		and one for outbound)

BmPrefsRecvMailView, BmPrefsSendMailView:
	-	added support for associating mail-filters with accounts

BmUtil:
	-	Fixed ugly bug in WordWrap() that would drop the last line of 
		a mail.

sieve.y, sieve-lex.l:
	-	added workaround for the (annoying) fact that flex is not being
		re-initialized correctly when we start to parse a new script.
		We now do the re-initialization ourselves (hopefully not missing
		anything...)

CLVEasyItem, CLVColumn
	-	fixed bug with right-justified columns not working properly

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2003-02-05: commit >

BmApp:
	-	updated credits (added Paweł Lewicki)
	-	added creation/deletion of FilterLists

BmEncoding:
	-	removed padding to field-name length from folding-code, since 
		it is useless
	-	fixed bug with one additional space being inserted during
		unfolding of non-address fields

BmFilter:
	-	created, a BmFilter contains info about one specific SIEVE-
		script.

BmListController:
	-	fixed auto-scrolling being activated when in fact it shouldn't.
		Now there is a 12-pixel scrollzone at the edge of a listview
		that activates auto-scrolling.
	-	The highlighted item is now updated during autoscroll (i.e. the
		highlight moves with the scroll).

BmLogHandler:
	-	added BM_LogFilter logging-type

BmMail:
	-	added support for storing mails in a destination folder that
		has been set by a mail-filter

BmMailFilter:
	-	created, a BmMailFilter executes a given BmFilter on a BmMail

BmMailHeader:
	-	removed padding to field-name length from folding-code, since 
		it is useless
	-	fixed a minor bug that caused Beam to select an suboptimal 
		from-address for a reply whenever an address-matching-fallback 
		has been found (although an address-exact-match exists, too). 

BmMultilineTextControl:
	-	completed support for automatic layout during resize

BmPopAccount:
	-	renamed "fallback"-account to "catch-all"-account

BmPopper:
	-	fixed crash when ns-lookup failed

BmPrefs:
	-	added BM_LogFilter logging-type

BmPrefsFilterView:
	-	created, contains functionality for editing a filter-list

BmPrefs...View:
	-	now include individual files instead of "liblayout-all.h"

BmPrefsWin:
	-	added two instances of BmPrefsFilterView (one inbound the
		other outbound).

BmSignature:
	-	added locking when accessing a dynamic signature

BmSmtp:
	-	fixed crash when ns-lookup failed

BmStorageUtil:
	-	fixed BmTempFileList::NextTempFilenameWithPath() to correctly
		insert a '/' between path and filename.

BmString:
	-	LockBuffer() now returns a buffer when asked for size 0 (this
		buffer is of length 1 to allow for storing the '\0'-terminator).
		This fixes a crash in BmStorageUtil::FetchFile() and other places.

Build.txt:
	-	added this file, containing a building-howto

MultiLineTextControl:
	-	fixed bug with textview still being editable when the 
		MultiLineTextControl has been disabled.

sieve.y:
	-	fixed two minor include-issues

sieve_err:
	-	added sieve_strerror()

libSieve:
	-	fiddled several files to make libSieve work on PPC

*******************************************************************************
[Beam test-03-01-27]

	summary:
		-	Beam now runs on PPC, too
		-	a (rather large) refactoring step has been done in order to simplify 
			handling of memory-/network-buffers and to reduce memory-footprint
		-	support for people-files has been included, just select from the
			"To:", "Cc:" or "Bcc:" menu.
		-	toolbar-buttons now support several text/icon-layouts and can serve for
			more than one action (prefs missing)
		-	mailing-lists are now properly supported, there are several ways to
			reply to a mail (reply-to-list, reply-to-person, be-smart, reply-to-all)
		-	support for swatch-internet-time added (prefs missing)

*******************************************************************************
< 2003-01-27: commit >

CLVColumn, CLVEasyItem:
	-	removed support for string-truncation that is not used by Beam
		but that used to eat a considerable amount of memory when 
		browsing large mail-folders

BmPrefsGeneralView:
	-	removed default-refview-layout and useStripedListView, since
		they did not really make sense

BmMailRef, BmMailRefList:
	-	removed dummy-items that used to be needed for the 
		default-layout view provided in prefs (which is now gone)
	-	changed constructors to take 'const BmString&'-parameters 
		instead of BmString, avoiding the copying overhead

BmBodyPartList, BmBodyPartView, BmDataModel, BmMailFolder, 
BmMailFolderView, BmMailRefView, BmPrefsRecvMailView, 
BmPrefsSendMailView, BmPrefsSignatureView:
	-	changed constructors to take 'const BmString&'-parameters 
		instead of BmString, avoiding the copying overhead

BmListController:
	-	optimised memory-footprint by providing the item-contents
		through GetUserText() instead of statically copying them
		into the list-view
	-	changed constructors to take 'const BmString&'-parameters 
		instead of BmString, avoiding the copying overhead

BmMail:
	-	changed iter++ to ++iter, just to be consistent (and because
		pre-increment is better for objects than post-increment)

BmMainWindow:
	-	fiddled with default-sizes

libSieve:
	-	fixed warnings during compilation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2003-01-22: commit >

folder build_ppc/release
	-	added project-files for PowerPC-version

many files:
	-	patched to compile & run under PowerPC

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2003-01-19: commit >

Beam_in_Parts*.proj:
	-	added BmNetJobModel.*

BmBodyPartList:
	-	changed first parameter of BmMemFilter-calls to be a pointer 
		instead of a reference

BmEncoding:
	-	removed BmDotstuff-(de/en)coder-classes, they now live in
		BmNetJobModel

BmJobStatusWin:
	-	QuitRequested() now takes a little snooze() in order to give 
		running jobs a chance to stop

BmLogHandler:
	-	corrected wrong number of spaces in linebreak-reformatting

BmMailView:
	-	corrected automatic cursor-positioning when the selected signature
		has changed

BmMemIO:
	-	BmStringIBuf now supports multiple buffers, i.e. you can add
		any number of input buffers to a BmStringIBuf which will pass
		them on to its output as if it was only one single buffer

BmNetJobModel:
	-	added this, which contains the following classes:
		+	BmNetJobModel, an abstraction of job-models that run over
			a network (i.e. send/receive data)
		+	BmNetIBuf, a BmMemIBuf-subclass that reads from a socket
		+	BmNetOBuf, a BmMemOBuf-subclass that writes to a socket
		+	BmDotStuffEncoder & BmDotStuffDecoder, that implement
			the dot-stuffing algorithm used by several mail-protocols
		+	BmStatusFilter, an abstract class for fetching data from
			a server and separate the answer into a status-part and an
			optional part containing additional data

BmPopAccount:
	-	made GetPOPAddress() deal properly with NULL-pointers

BmPopper:
	-	reworked network-code to make use of BmNetJobModel base-class
		(and other classes from BmNetJobModel)
	-	added BmPopStatusFilter, a BmMemFilter that knows how to separate
		POP3-status messages from additional answer-data and is able to
		interprete the status-messages

BmSmtpAccount:
	-	made GetSMTPAddress() deal properly with NULL-pointers

BmSmtp:
	-	reworked network-code to make use of BmNetJobModel base-class
		(and other classes from BmNetJobModel)

		interprete the status-messages

BmWindow, BmMainWindow, BmMailEditWin, BmMailViewWin:
	-	fixed problem with CUT/COPY/UNDO-messages being sent in an
		infinite loop if the focus-view does not understand them
	-	moved handling of CUT/COPY/UNDO-messages into BmWindow

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2003-01-14: commit >

BmBodyPartList:
	-	fixed encoding/conversion being the wrong way round in
		ConstructBodyForSending(). We have to convert first, then
		encode...

BmEncoding:
	-	NeedsEncoding now explicitly takes an utf8-string (it
		actually doesn't matter, but I wanted to clear things up).

BmMail, BmMailEditWin:
	-	ConstructBodyForSending now gets the editedText as UTF8-
		string as opposed to a string in the mail's native charset

BmPeople:
	-	fixed bug where persons with empty emails would be added to
		their respective groups, resulting in a crash when actually
		trying to display this group's list of mail-addresses

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2003-01-12: commit >

BmStorageUtil:
	-	fixed bug in BmReadStringAttr that would read the terminating
		'\0' into the string, too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2003-01-10: commit >

*.proj:
	-	added missing BmString-support to bone-/release-projects

BmEncoding:
	-	implemented a redesigned decoding/encoding scheme
		based on BmMemFilter derivatives, quoted-printable and
		base64 are done.

< 2003-01-01: commit >

BmBodyPartList, BmMail, BmMeilHeader, BmMailView:
	-	reimplemented buffer handling to use BmMemFilters and/or
		BmMemIO-classes, resulting in much less memory being used 
		when handling large mails

BmEncoding:
	-	finished the redesigned decoding/encoding scheme
		based on BmMemFilter derivatives
	-	re-implemented the conversion and en/de-coding functions
		to use BmMemfilters
	-	optimzed quoted-printable and esp. base64-code

BmMailHeaderView:
	-	added timezone to string when displaying times converted to
		localtime

BmMailRef:
	-	added missing support for swatch-time when reading attributes
		directly from file (as opposed to reading from archive).

BmMemIO:
	-	finsished implementation of memory-/string-IO classes

BmPopper:
	-	enlarged network buffer-sizes to 64KB
	-	switch from class-constant to Prefs-field "NetReceiveBufferSize"

BmPrefs:
	-	added field "NetReceiveBufferSize"

BmSmtp:
	-	enlarged network buffer-sizes to 64KB
	-	reimplemented buffer handling to use BmMemFilters, resulting
		in a much less memory being used when handling large mails

BmString:
	-	changed RemoveAll()-functions to use _ReplaceAll()

BmUtil:
	-	fixed local/utc-confusion in TimeToSwatchString()

base64:
	-	removed, functionality has been moved to BmEncoding

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2002-12-28: commit >

BmApp, BmBasics, BmBusyView, BmController, BmDataModel, BmEncoding,
BmGutUtil, BmJobStatusWin, BmListController, BmLogHandler, BmMailFolder,
BmMailFolderView, BmMailMover, BmMailRef, BmMailRefList, BmMailView,
BmMailViewWin, BmMainWindow, BmNetUtil, BmPeople, BmPopAccount,
BmPopper, BmPrefs*View, BmPrefsWin, BmRefManager, BmResources,
BmRulerView, BmSignature, BmSmtpAccount, BmToolbarButton, BmWindow,
BmDeskbarView, regexx, split, WrappingTextView:
	-	switched from BString to BmString

BmBodyPartList:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	we now decode/convert bodyparts only at the point when this
		data is actually needed (lazy evaluation), resulting in a
		better performance for the usual case where only an overview
		of the bodypart is being displayed, but no data accessed.
		N.B.: For best performance, we'd have to resort to displaying 
		the length of each bodypart in its encoded form (set the Prefs-
		value "ShowDecodedLength" to false for that), but 
		since this might confuse our users, we better stick with 
		showing the correct, decoded values.
	-	fixed bug in multipart-parsing that caused any multipart
		to actually handle the text contained within its boundaries
		itself, in effect resulting in this text being added to a mail
		twice during save, first by the multipart (incorrect) and the 
		through its children (correct).

BmBodyPartView:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	added support for prefs value "ShowDecodedSizeOfAttachments"

BmMail:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	reactivated Mail-proxy, so that a mail exists only once in
		Beam, no matter how often it is being used.

BmMailEditWin:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	fixed bug that caused Beam to ignore any changes within textviews
		except the subject-field.

BmMailFolderList:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	improved performance of new-mail-detection on startup by
		freezing the list during the query, then thawing it and update
		the appropriate mail-folders manually, afterwards.

BmMailHeader:
	-	fixed bug in BmAddressList::SplitIntoAddresses() which caused
		addr-lists that contained two phraseless route-addresses 
		enclosed by <> to be garbled. The following address is an
		example: 
			<test1@xxx.de>, <test2@yyy.com>
		came out as:
			test1@xxx.de>, <test2@yyy.com
	-	switched from BString to BmString

BmMailHeaderView:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	added support for pref-value "TimeModeInHeaderView", which can
		be used to select between three time-modes:
		   + native (showing the date as formatted within the mail)
		   + local (showing date converted to localtime)
		   + swatch (showing date converted to swatch-internet-time)

BmMailRefView:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	added support for showing timestamps as swatch-internet-time

BmPrefs:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	added fields: 
		+ "TimeModeInHeaderView"
		+ "UseSwatchTimeInRefView"

BmSmtp:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	optimized handling of sending large mails to several Bcc-
		recipients. The mailtext is now prepared once (in advance)
		instead of being prepared for each and every recipient.

BmStorageUtil:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	added BmReadStringAttr()

BmString:
	-	added to project, codebase is from OpenBeOS and has been 
		renamed and modified for Beam's needs.

BmUtil:
	-	switched from BString to BmString
	-	as a result of the switch to BmString, several util-methods
		that used to reside in BmUtil have been integrated into BmString.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2002-12-18: commit (new CVS-folder layout) >

all:
	-	reworked CVS-folder layout to be easier to understand and
		work with

BmApp:
	-	in RefsReceived() we traverse links now

BmBodyPartList:
	-	fixed bug with initializers relying on declaration order
		(which in fact was the other way around)
	-	reworked & simplified multipart-handling (and introduced 
		PruneUnneededMultiParts() for that purpose)

BmBodyPartView:
	-	we avoid complaining about mimetype-mismatches if the real
		mimetype is (or rather, BeOS believes it to be) text/plain

BmMail:
	-	reworked things so that ConstructBodyForSending() does not
		require reinitialization of mail. This way we avoid reparsing
		the mail's contents during a save

BmRulerView:
	-	fixed initializers relying on declaration order

BmStorageUtil:
	-	in DetermineMimeType() we traverse links now

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2002-12-16: commit >

BmBodyPartList:
	-	when creating a bodypart from a given file, we no longer
		doublecheck the files mimetype, since that exposes the
		problem of the BeOS text/x-email mimetype sniffer-rule not
		correctly identifying outgoing emails as such (it thinks
		they are text/plain).
		This fix complies with the following concept about data:
		trust local info, but do not trust remote info.

BmBodyPartView:
	-	changed mimetype-check of attachments in such a way that
		Beam now offers to open the attachment with the real or
		the declared mimetype, thus allowing for easier handling of
		cases where BeOS' idea of a files mimetype is wrong.

BmMail:
	-	always display correct originator in reply-intro, instead
		of (under some circumstances) showing the list address

BmMailEditWin:
	-	the window-title now reflects the mail's current subject

BmPeople:
	-	fixed problem of duplicate mails being shown
	-	added 'All People'-submenu

BmStorageUtil:
	-	minor cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2002-12-12: commit>

BmApp:
	-	fixed bug when replying to several mails: addresses 
		with different phrases but identical addr-specs are now
		handled as one single address

BmBodyPartList:
	-	redesigned and reactivated support for encoding-selection
		by user

BmBodyPartView:
	-	now logs into MailParser.log

BmLogHandler:
	-	now show correct micro-seconds when logging

BmMail:
	-	added DetermineReplyAddress(), a central place where
		the different reply-modes are handled
		
BmMailHeader:
	-	added BmAddressList::AddrSpecsAsString(), which extracts
		only the addr-specs from an addresslist

BmMailEditWin:
	-	changed people-selection-code to provide menus for
		different groups of people

BmMailView:
	-	now logs into MailParser.log
	-	redesigned and reactivated support for encoding-selection
		by user

BmPeople:
	-	completed implementation of people-selection

libregexx/split:
	-	added split() and splitex() functions that return the
		resulting vector through passed-in references (faster)
	-	fixed incorrect handling of last match in split()/splitex()

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2002-12-10: commit>

Beam_in_Parts_*bone.proj, Beam_in_Parts_release.proj:
	-	added missing BmPeople.*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2002-12-10: commit>

BmListViewController:
	-	added support for automatic scrolling during drag'n'drop

BmMail:
	-	added support for very long words (urls) being wrapped when 
		they should not be

BmMailView:
	-	added support for very long words (urls) being wrapped when 
		they should not be

BmUtil:
	-	ConvertTabsToSpaces(): made tabwidth configurable
	-	WordWrap() now cares for words that exceed the maximum
		line length (like URLs) to not be wrapped

ColumnListView:
	-	small cleanups

WrappingTextView:
	-	added support for moving cursor wordwise when pressing
		ALT/CONTROL and cursor-keys

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
< 2002-12-08: commit>

BmApp:
	-	mailto: now supports arbitrary parameters (not only subject)
	-	added support for reply_list and reply_originator

BmBodyPartList:
	-	fixed bug with newlines not being handled correctly during
		ContentField-parsing.
		
BmMail:
	-	added two new reply-types, list and originator
	-	made smart reply-type detection as the default reply-type,
		where Beam automatically tries to determine wether to reply
		to the list or to the person

BmMailEditWin:
	-	added variations to send-button
	-	fixed bug with bcc-field not being visible (but latch indicating
		that it should be)

BmMailFolderView:
	-	repaired non-working handling of latch by key-press

BmMailHeader:
	-	added DetermineListAddress()

BmMailRefView:
	-	added reply_list and reply_originator to menu

BmMailViewWin:
	-	added variations to reply- and forward-buttons

BmMainWindow:
	-	added variations to reply- and forward-buttons

BmPrefs:
	-	switched DefaultForwardType from int- to string-type

	-	original patch has been submitted by Rainer Riedl, thanks!

BmPeople:
	-	created, contains BmPeopleList

BmUtil:
	-	added GenerateSortkeyFor()	



*******************************************************************************
[Beam v0.914, 2002-11-29]:
*******************************************************************************
	BmApplication:
		-	mark mails as read before trashing them in order to avoid confusing
			the new-mail counter.
	
	BmDeskbarItem:
		-	shrunk menu-font to 10 points.
		-	removed LivesInTrash(), since that didn't make any sense.
	
	BmEncoding:
		-	added IsCompatibleWithText() in order to check attachments of type
			text if they really are text (not binary), before they are being
			added to a mail. This is needed in the special case where an attachment
			lives on a non-BeOS filesystem (thus not having reliable filetypes).
			For Instance, BeOS believes that MS-Word documents on a FAT32-partition
			are of type text/plain, while in fact they contain binary data.
			To avoid Beam chopping off the file, we do this sanity check first.
	
	BmGuiUtils:
		-	changed handling of shortcuts in CreateMenuItem() such that trailing
			dots are removed.
	
	BmLogHandler:
		-	replaced calls to BString::ReplaceAll with ReplaceSubstringWith().
	
	BmMail:
		-	fixed crash in quoting-code when long lines containing only spaces
			were encountered.
			
	BmMailEditWin:
		-	now we clobber a mail's date only if it is not a redirection, since
			in that case the original date *must not* be fiddled with.
		-	After constructing a mail's text afresh, we now update the mail's
			connections to it's controllers, since the datamodel's for the
			body and the header have been changed. This fixes the bug that
			caused Beam to ignore changes to the bodypartlist (attachments)
			when the mail has been saved once (from inside the maileditview).
			After the first save, the connection to the (old) bodypartlist 
			persisted so that any further changes to the attachments would be
			lost. This bug could lead to lost/unwanted attachments when a mail
			was finally sent.
		-	Corrected field-value check for the case of a redirected mail
			(we have to check the resent-... fields in that case).
			
	BmMailFolder:
		-	instead of using one locker per mail-folder, we now use a single
			static locker to protect the ref-lists of all mail-folders. There were 
			just too many lockers around.
	
	BmMailFolderList:
		-	the new-mail counter does not anymore check if new mail lives
			in trash, since that is unreliable anyway (moves inside/outside 
			trash are not seen). We just hope that there'll never be any
			new mail in trash...
	
	BmMailHeader:
		-	several cosmetic changes that faciliate correct handling of empty
			group-addresslists.
		-	the regexx that was used to split the mail-header into separate
			fields used too much stack space (leading to crashes), so we now use
			hand-coded field-separation.
	
	BmMailRef:
		-	when errors occur during construction, we now only log the errors
			instead of popping up alerts for them, in order to behave in a
			more sensible way if other mail-software is around (like MDR).
	
	BmMailView:
		-	added UpdateControllers() that reinstalls controller/datamodel 
			connections.
	
	BmPrefs:
		-	patched archive-version to 3
		-	changed handling of shortcuts such that trailing dots are removed.
			This avoids problems when adding/removing dots in the menu-items.
			
	BmSmtp:
		-	fix problem that made Beam try to send empty rcpt-commands to
			server for empty group-addresslists.
	
	BmStorageUtil:
		-	Fixed MoveToTrash so that it works with LocaleTracker, too.
			We now use find_directory() to get the desktop-path and then 
			target the tracker message to that window (usually 
			"/boot/home/Desktop"). This seems to work for both OpenTracker and
			LocaleTracker.
		-	Fixed MoveToTrash even more to work with all known Trackers
			(5.00, 5.02, OpenTracker and LocaleTracker). Now both 'Desktop' and
			'/boot/home/Desktop' are tried as base-windows.
		-	removed LivesInTrash(), since that didn't make any sense.
			
	BmUtil:
		-	added ReplaceSubstringWith() to avoid the use of the pathetic
			BString::ReplaceAll().
	
	general node-monitoring:
		-	we do not any longer show errors on screen, since there are just
			to many of them happening, esp. when MDR is running. MDR seems to 
			create and then immediately rename/move mails, which would confuse
			Beam ever to often. So now at least Beam is quiet about it...

	release-projects:
		-	replaced -fomit-frame-pointer with -fno-omit-frame-pointer, since
			this way the obscure crashes that some people have experienced
			during send/receive don't (seem to) occur. While at it, we removed
			the unneeded -no-pic, too.
	
[Beam v0.913, 2002-11-15]:
	all:
		-	added a +1 to many BString::LockBuffer() calls in order to have enough
			room for the trailing '\0'. The BeBook isn't too clear about this, so we 
			play safe.
			
	BmApp:
		-	replaced old, overly simple deskbar-item with new implementation
		-	in QuitRequested() we now find out if there is any window that does 
			not want to quit yet. Only if there's no veto, we go on and really quit
			all windows and the app.
	
	BmBodyPartList:
		-	added functionality to automatically determine the correct mimetype
			of any attachment during open/save, if that mimetype has no or an
			incorrect mimetype set.
		-	now Beam no longer complains about empty multipart bodies, where the
			boundary appears only once (with appended '--')
	
	BmBodyPartView:
		-	now verifies advertised mimetype before opening an attachment
	
	BmDataModel:
		-	added HandleError(), which knows when to log and/or show errors
	
	BmDeskbarView:
		-	added implementation of a real deskbar-view that does not seem to crash
			the original R5-deskbar anymore
	
	BmEncoding:
		-	fixed bug introduced in 0.913rc2 that would incorrectly handle softbreaks
			that were followed by only a single character. This resulted in newlines being 
			removed were they shouldn't and the mail-layout being somewhat garbled.
			N.B.: This bug affected only the displaying of mails, not the actual mail
			generation.
		-	fixed bug with quoted-printable encoding that would let an underscore-char
			pass through unencoded (which would lead to erraneous results in the 
			decoding stage, in turn messing up iso-2022-jp encodings, which in turn
			would cut off messages!).
	
	BmJobStatusWin:
		-	changed filter-hack to start immediately after all popper-jobs have finished,
			not after they have been removed from the status-win.
	
	BmListController:
		-	enhanced "spring-loaded"-opening of folders in such a way that the 
			timer-triggered expand/collapse would not occur when the user has
			expanded/collapsed the current item manually (by moving the mouse 
			over the expander).
	
	BmLogHandler:
		-	now we are logging proper timestamps (with msecs)
		-	BM_LOGERR now always logs into current logfile, too
		
	BmMail:
		-	a race-condition that occurs when multiple mails are being deleted through
			the trash would sometimes lead to the strange effect that the mail-ref would
			select and try to display a message that has just been deleted. In this case
			an error message was shown that complained about the deleted message
			not being there >:o/ Now we simply do not display such a message but
			ignore a missing message quietly.
		-	when creating a reply, the algorithm by which we determine the receiving
			address (the new from) has been improved to handle gracefully the case
			where the account that has received the mail could not be found anymore
			(for instance because it has been renamed).
		-	corrected handling of multiple originators when generating reply-/forward-intro.
		-	set default from-account when redirecting mails
	
	BmMailFolder:
		-	fixed bug in AddMailRef() & RemoveMailRef() where the methods would
			return without handling the needed new-mail status-changes.
	
	BmMailView:
		-	added missing conversion to local linebreaks for mimeparts that
			make use of the 'binary' content-transfer-encoding.
		-	added support for copying URLs to clipboard
	
	BmPopper:
		-	from now on, errors are shown only when ShouldContinue() yields true
	
	BmPrefs...View:
		-	changed minimum sizes to cooperate with 800*600 screens
		
	BmResources:
		-	added sanity-check to FetchOwnFQDN() that removes any newlines 
			from hostname/domain.
			
	BmSmtp:
		-	from now on, errors are shown only when ShouldContinue() yields true
	
	BmUtil:
		-	fixed buffer-overflow in ConvertTabsToSpaces() that caused many crashes.
		-	now WordWrap() works correctly even if the to-be-wrapped text doesn't
			end with a newline
		-	removed call to LockBuffer( 0) that doesn't work under Dano
	
	ColumnListView:
		-	added a workaround for the problem with the BListView not correctly
			scrolling down with the selection when the user uses Shift-CursorDown
			to extend the selection beyond the visible items.
		-	pressing escape now deselects all items. This way it is possible to get
			out of the all-items-are-selected trap (cursor would not move anymore).
	
	PCRE:
		-	updated to pcre v3.9


[Beam v0.913rc2, 2002-06-14]:
	BmBodyPartList:
		-	fixed crashing bug when saving non-text attachments
		-	now transfer-encodings like '8bits' are handled correctly (as '8bit')
	
	BmEncoding
		-	qp-lines ending with an *encoded* '=' were incorrectly joined with
			the following line (only plain [non-encoded] '=' indicate a soft-wrap).
		
	BmJobStatusWin:
		-	a PopperView now only beeps once when new mail has arrived
		-	when a complete Popper-run is done, Beam looks for an executable
			named 'filter' in the app's home folder, which is then executed. 
			This way, external mail filtering can be done.
	
	BmListViewController:
		-	added support for delayed auto-expand/-collapse during drag
		-	fixed leaking of all items in destructor...this additionally closes
			the reference leaks that showed when closing prefs-window
	
	BmMailEditWin:
		-	fixed bug that caused unmodified mails to not be hard-wrapped
			before send
		-	if there's only one smtp-account, it is selected automatically
	
	BmMailFolderView
		-	pressing the right control-key while moving the mouse-wheel or using the 
			cursor-keys will scroll the mail-view (only left key was working before)
	
	BmMailRefView:
		-	fixed ref-leak when handling a drop
		-	pressing the right control-key while moving the mouse-wheel or using the 
			cursor-keys will scroll the mail-view (only left key was working before)
		
	BmMailView:
		-	when pasting text, now the font of the mailview is forced upon the
			pasted text
		-	signatures with special characters are now displayed correctly 
			(superfluous conversion to UTF8 removed).
		-	when the user has selected a new signature, the cursor is now positioned
			immediately *before* the new sig-text (not at the end of the sig, as before).
		-	pressing the right control-key while moving the mouse-wheel or using the 
			cursor-keys will scroll the mailref-view (only left key was working before)
	
	BmMainWindow:
		-	removed ref-leak in BmMainMenuBar, which occurred whenever any 
			pop-account was added/removed/changed.
		-	fixed problem with BmMainMenuBar not showing any Pop-Accounts at all.
			
	WrappingTextView:
		-	fixed bug when undoing a deletion (now the deleted text is saved
			*before* it is being deleted from textview, err...)

[Beam v0.913rc1, 2002-05-09]:

	base64:
		-	added (code comes straight from MDR). This code replaces the one
			supplied by BeOS that crashes upon encountering incorrect data.

	Beam_release.proj:
		-	added -no-fpic -fomit-frame-pointer parameters for better code
	
	Beam...bone.proj
		-	added separate project-files for bone-/dano-version.
	
	BmApp:
		-	joined replies/forwards now correctly generate subjects through 
			BmMail::CreateXXXSubjectFor()-methods.
			Additionally, now the first subject gets copied into the joined mail
			plus a ' (and more...)', indicating that there's more than one subject.
		-	added support for subjects and URL-encodings in mailto: URLs
		-	when marking mails as read that are not new (replied, forwarded, etc.)
			Beam now asks the user whether to just mark new mails or really
			mark all.
		-	fixed reference-leak when printing mails
		-	fixed crash in RefsReceived when a non-mail reference has been received
		
	BmBodyPartList:
		-	Erraneous MIME-headers with missing semicolon between field-value and 
			attributes no longer cause an exception (they are now silently accepted).
	
	BmBodyPartView:
		-	fixed bug with icons being cut off down the tree hierarchy
	
	BmDataModel:
		-	BmListModel now sets and updates a mNeedsStore-flag as needed (this
			flag indicates that the list has changed and should be stored)
		
	BmEncoding:
		-	replaced BeOS-native base64-routines by the ones from MDR (which do not
			seem to crash).
	
	BmJobStatusWin:
		-	removed Window()->UpdateIfNeeded()-call in BmPopperView::AskUserForPwd(),
			since that's potentially unsafe and is not needed anyway.
		-	improved look'n'feel of password-acquisitors
		-	added support for beep-event when new mail arrived.
		-	fixed problem with auto-checks removing job-window when they
			should not.
	
	BmMail:
		-	fixed bug in AddPartsFromMail which always added forward-intro, even
			if current mail was a reply.
		-	filename-creation now respects B_FILE_NAME_LENGTH
		-	when creating reply-/forward-intro, %s now expands to subject and
			\n to newline.
		-	quoting now handles non-trivial encodings better (like iso-2022-jp), now
			the character-count is used instead of the byte-count.
		-	saving a message does not re-read it from disk anymore, since this does
			not make sense anymore (not that it used to make much sense before...)
		
	BmMailEditWin:
		-	hardwrapping is only executed directly before a mail is sent (not when
			it is saved as draft).
		-	now the mail-date is bumped whenever the mail is saved (per default)
		
	BmMailFolderView:
		-	now allows scrolling of refview by SHIFT-modifier and scrolling of mailview
			by CONTROL-modifier
	
	BmMailRefList:
		-	now the mailref-cache is only stored when neccessary
		-	changed structure of mail-cache for better performance when reading/
			writing the cache.
	
	BmMailView:
		-	mouse-cursor changes if hovering over URL
		-	fixed BTextView-issue when typing spaces at end of line, now only
			one space is accepted.
		-	the TextRect is now recalculated when the font changes
		-	added multi-level undo (limited only by available memory)
			
	BmPopAccount:
		-	when re-reading POP-account-settings within prefs, the state of downloaded
			messages must be kept as is (not re-read), since otherwise Beam may
			download messages again that already were downloaded before.
		
	BmPrefs:
		-	now all public calls are secured by a locker, since when resetting prefs to
			saved state, we might be causing crashes without the lock.
	
	BmPrefsGeneralView:
		-	checkbox added for new-mail beep-event (on/off)
	
	BmPrefsMailReadView:
		-	fixed non-working AutoCheckOnlyIfPPPRunning-checkbox
		-	fixed non-working MarkAsReadDelay-control.
		
	BmPrefsRecvMailView:
		-	added sanity-check
	
	BmPrefsSendMailView:
		-	fixed state-handling (enabling/disabling) properly
		-	added sanity-check
	
	BmSignature:
		-	dynamic signatures are now interpreted as a shell-script, not as one
			single command
	
	WrappingTextView:
		-	when removing characters (e.g. by pressing Delete), a modification-msg
			now indicates the state change

v0.912, 2002-04-14
	-	better support for forwarding & replying to multiple messages at once,
		now you can choose whether or not to join the messages.
	-	added support for printing one or more messages.
	-	corrected some MIME-problems, increasing robustness and eliminating 
		the compatibility-problems Beam had with other mail-programs 
		(like Mail-It or Eudora). These programs now accept Beam-generated 
		MIME-messages, including quoted-printables and attachments.
	-	doubleclicking a folder now opens the corresponding Tracker-window.
	-	deactivating the Desktop-icon does work now.
	-	added configurable delay before a shown mail is being marked as read.
	-	added option for using 8-bit-mime when constructing mails.
	-	added an option to switch between soft/hard-wrapping of the mailtext 
		(Beam always used soft-wrapping before).
	-	when requested, Beam can now contact a POP3/SMTP-server and suggest 
		the best (most "secure") authentication type.
	-	and other (minor) bugfixes, usability and GUI-enhancements.

v0.911, 2002-03-24
	-	fixed stupid bug that caused Beam to crash if no FolderView-state
		exists (like after first install)
	-	forwarding attachments works correctly now

v0.91, 2002-03-24
	-	header-view contents are now selectable and draggable.
	-	added support for redirecting mails.
	-	Beam now works under Dano (BeOS 5.1).
	-	signature support added (for static and dynamic signatures).
	-	added automatic mail-checking (every xx minutes).
	-	all shortcuts are now configurable via prefs.
	-	added better quoting-modes (simple, push-margin and auto-wrap)
		in order to reduce comb-like effect.
	-	added option to show in- & out-folders always at top.
	-	added tooltips to all preferences-controls, which is one step
		on the way to better usability (but Online-Help still missing).
	-	added Deskbar icon indicating the presence of new mail.
		(This seems to constantly crash the R5 Deskbar, but it works
		for OpenTracker & Dano versions...)
	-	Display-font can now be selected when viewing/editing mails.
	-	Beam can now set itself up as preferred email application.
	-	fixed problems with node-monitoring stopping to work after a
		recreate-cache.
	-	Beam now correctly shows BeOS standard-icons for mails, if 
		Beam is preferred app.
	-	fixed incorrect mail-address creation in case of phrases containing
		commas (like: Meyer, Justin <xx@yyy.zz>). This would now be created
		as "Meyer, Justin" <xx@yyy.zz>.
	-	fixed problems with highlighting URLs that contain a tilde ('~').
	-	many more bugfixes

v0.903, 2002-02-22
	-	Beam no longer complains about unknown prefs-field 'BeMailStyle'.

v0.902, 2002-02-22
	-	removed crashing bug when wildly moving through mailfolder-view.
	-	disabled selecting and invoking for	the dummy-mailrefview used in prefs.
	-	make the reply-mode with selected text work (only selected text will be
		included in reply).

v0.901, 2002-02-21
	-	enable people to send mail if there is no working name-service
		(Beam used to complain that it could not determine own hostname).
		In this case, Beam now uses host/domain info from network settings-file.
													[thx to the many people who reported this]
	-	preferences window is now moved to front when a user tries to open it twice
		(instead of crashing, as before).
	-	recreating a mailfolder-cache now works.
	-	new prefs-flag that selects BeMail-compatible shortcuts.
	-	when a new node has been detected and seems to have zero size, we assume
		that an application is creating the mail-file directly inside the in-folder.
		In this case, we snooze for a short amount of time and then proceed to
		read the file, which hopefully is now completely written.
		This is no complete solution, but I hope that this will increase 
		compatibility with MailDaemonReplacement and other programs.
	-	fixed a couple of smaller redraw/layout issues

v0.90, 2002-02-19
	- first public release
