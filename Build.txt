Build-Howto for Beam:
---------------------------

In order to be able to compile Beam, you need to have the following setup:


1.	You need the Beam-source (yes, trust me!), either get the current source-
	release (beam_src_xxx.zip) or fetch the up-to-date source fresh from 
	Beam's CVS-server:
	
	1.1. Open a Terminal and cd into the folder where you would like Beam to 
	   live (a folder named beam will be created in here, see below).

	1.2. Login to the CVS-server:

		export BEAM_REP=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/beam
		cvs -d$BEAM_REP login

		(press return when you are asked for a password)
Â 
	1.3. Decide which source branch you want (release, stable or development).
		Two CVS-tags exist in order to clearly separate these two branches:
		'current-stable' & 'current-release' on the stable branch and 
		'current-devel' on the development-branch (the head).

		- The 'current-release' tag points to the latest full public release
		  (i.e. Beam-versions that have been published on BeBits).
		  [Choose this if all you want is the source of the last public release].

		- The 'current-stable' tag points to the most up-to-date code in the
		  stable branch that should work just fine.
		  [Choose this if you need all the latest patches, and are prepared
		   to accept one or more minor temporary glitches].

		- The 'current-devel' tag points to the newest development code that
		  deserves it (i.e. is considered not to be a health risk...).
		  [Choose this if you want to have a look (and say) at where Beam is 
		   heading. Be prepared to live with random crashes and weird stuff!]

		- N.B.: Checking out the HEAD of the CVS is probably no good idea.
		  This will give you the highest chance of data-loss (*if* the code
		  compiles at all...).

	1.4.	Fetching the CVS-tree:

		Depending on the version you want, please do the following:
	
		1.4.1	For the release code do:

				cvs -z3 -d$BEAM_REP co -r current-release beam

		1.4.2	For the latest stable code do:

				cvs -z3 -d$BEAM_REP co -r current-stable beam

		1.4.3	For the latest development code do:

				cvs -z3 -d$BEAM_REP co -r current-devel beam

		(that will take some time)
	
	After that has finished, a folder named 'beam' should have been created 
	which contains the complete source-files.


2.	Since Beam requires liblayout to run, it needs the liblayout-SDK during
	compilation, so fetch this from:

		http://www.xs4all.nl/~marcone/be.html

	and install (copy) the "headers"-folder included in the archive to 
		~/config/include/ 
	and rename it to "liblayout", after which there should exist a file 
		~/config/include/liblayout/layout.h 
	(and several others...)


3.	Beam requires PCRE (Perl-Compatible-Regular-Expressions) to run, so 
	during compilation Beam	expects the following files to exist:
		/boot/home/config/include/pcre.h
		/boot/home/config/include/pcreposix.h
		/boot/home/config/lib/libpcre.so
		/boot/home/config/lib/libpcreposix.so

	If you haven't got PCRE already, you can fetch it from:

		http://bebits.bebits.com/app/3845

	After extracting the archive, simply drag'n'drop the files as indicated
	by the folder-names.


4.	Instead of using BeIDE or make, Beam now exclusively supports jam as
	build engine. You can fetch jam (v2.5-obos) from here:
	
		http://www.hirschkaefer.de/beos/jam-2.5-obos.zip
		
	Simply extract the archive and move 'jam' to /boot/home/config/bin.

5.	In order to finally compile Beam, you just need to open a terminal,
	cd into Beam's main-folder and start jam. This will take a while...

	After jam is finished, you can find the result in generated/distro 
	(or generated/distro_debug, depending on settings).

	N.B.: If you are interested in fiddling with the build (i.e. activate 
	debugging info), please have a look at build-jam/UserBuildConfig.sample. 
	In this file you'll find more info about what you can do.

Have fun!


Please don't hesitate to ask me if you encounter any problems during compilation.


cheers,
	Oliver   <beam@hirschkaefer.de>
