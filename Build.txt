Build-Howto for Beam:
---------------------------

In order to be able to compile Beam, you need to have the following setup:


1.	You need the Beam-source (yes, trust me!), either get the current source-
	release (beam_src_xxx.zip) or fetch the up-to-date source fresh from 
	Beam's CVS-server:
	
	1. Open a Terminal and cd into the folder where you would like Beam to 
	   live (a folder named beam will be created in here, see below).

	2. Login to the CVS-server:

		cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/beam login

		(press return when you are asked for a password)
Â 
	3. Fetch the CVS-tree:

		cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/beam co beam

		(that will take some time)
	
	After that has finished, a folder named 'beam' should have been created 
	which contains the complete source-files.



2.	Since Beam requires liblayout to run, it needs the liblayout-SDK during
	compilation, so fetch this from:

		http://www.xs4all.nl/~marcone/be.html

	and install (copy) the "headers"-folder included in the archive to 
		~/config/include/ 
	and rename it to "liblayout", after which there should exist a file 
		~/config/include/liblayout/layout.h 
	(and several others...)



3.	In order to compile the libSieve-subproject, Beam requires a BeIDE plugin
	that knows how to handle yacc and flex input files (.y and .l files). 
	Please fetch this plugin from BeBits:
	
		http://bebits.bebits.com/app/3166
		
	and install it (by dragging the plugin into the folder "drag_plugin_here").
	
	Please note that you need to fetch the 0.5 version of the plugin (or newer), 
	since with the initial version, Beam won't link correctly.


4.	In order to finally compile Beam, you just have to open and make the 
	appropriate BeIDE-project, but since there are quite a few of those, you 
	need to decide if you just want to use Beam or if you want to fiddle 
	with its code (and thus would like debugging and logging facilities):

	a. Compiling Beam for general use (a release build):

		- For BeOS R5 x86, select beam/build/release/Beam_release.proj
		- For BeOS BONE or Dano, select beam/build/release/Beam_bone_release.proj
		- For BeOS R5 PPC, select beam/build_ppc/release/Beam_ppc.proj

	b. Compiling Beam with debugging and logging (a development build):

		- For BeOS R5 x86, select beam/build/devel/Beam.proj
		- For BeOS BONE or Dano, select beam/build/devel/Beam_bone.proj
		- (For BeOS R5 PPC there currently is no devel-project, sorry)

	After you have opened the appropriate project-file, you will see that it uses 
	a number of sub-projects. Just do a make on the top-level project and a 
	couple of minutes later, Beam should be all done.


Have fun!


Please don't hesitate to ask me if you encounter any problems during compilation.


cheers,
