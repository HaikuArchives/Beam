Build-Howto for Beam:
---------------------------

In order to be able to compile Beam, you need to have the following setup:


1.	You need the Beam-source (yes, trust me!), either get the current source-
	release (beam_src_xxx.zip) or fetch the up-to-date source fresh from 
	Beam's GIT-repository:
	
	1.1. Open a Terminal and cd into the folder where you would like Beam to 
	   live (a folder named beam will be created in here, see below).

	1.4.	Clone the git repository:

		1.4.1	If you just want read access:
		
				git clone git://beam.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/beam/beam beam

		1.4.2	If you'd like to push your own commits, too:

				git clone ssh://beam.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/beam/beam beam

		(that will take some time)
	
	After that has finished, a folder named 'beam' should have been created 
	which contains the complete source-files.


2.	Since Beam requires liblayout to run, it needs the liblayout-SDK during
	compilation, so fetch this from:

		http://www.xs4all.nl/~marcone/be.html

	and install (copy) the "headers"-folder included in the archive to 
		~/config/include/ 
	and rename it to "liblayout", after which there should exist a file 
		~/config/include/liblayout/layout.h 
	(and several others...)


3.	Beam requires PCRE (Perl-Compatible-Regular-Expressions) to run, so 
	during compilation Beam	expects the following files to exist:
		/boot/home/config/include/pcre.h
		/boot/home/config/include/pcreposix.h
		/boot/home/config/lib/libpcre.so
		/boot/home/config/lib/libpcreposix.so

	If you haven't got PCRE already, you can fetch it from:

		http://bebits.bebits.com/app/3845

	After extracting the archive, simply drag'n'drop the files as indicated
	by the folder-names.


4.	Beam requires libiconv.so (an encoding conversion library) to run, so 
	during compilation Beam	expects the following files to exist:
		/boot/home/config/include/iconv.h

	If you haven't got libiconv.so already, you can fetch it from:

		http://www.bebits.com/app/3527

	After extracting the archive, simply start the package-file.


5.	Instead of using BeIDE or make, Beam now exclusively supports jam as
	build engine. You can fetch jam (v2.5-obos) from here:
	
		http://www.hirschkaefer.de/beos/jam-2.5-obos.zip
		
	Simply extract the archive and move 'jam' to /boot/home/config/bin.

6.	In order to finally compile Beam, you just need to open a terminal,
	cd into Beam's main-folder and start jam. This will take a while...

	After jam is finished, you can find the result in generated/distro 
	(or generated/distro_debug, depending on settings).

	N.B.: If you are interested in fiddling with the build (i.e. activate 
	debugging info), please have a look at build-jam/UserBuildConfig.sample. 
	In this file you'll find more info about what you can do.

Have fun!


Please don't hesitate to ask me if you encounter any problems during compilation.


cheers,
