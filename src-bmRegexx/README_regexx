Regexx README

This is the Regexx 0.97 release.

Regexx has been developed as a wrapper to the GNU regex functions
to avoid reinventing the wheel. When I was developing it, I had in
mind a good implementation that would allow me to do almost everything
I could in softwares like perl but keep it easy to use. We're getting
there, I think. :-)

Check the TODO file to see future plans for Regexx.

Please, send bug reports to <bug-regexx@nn.com.br>.
