# UserBuildConfig
#
# Sample of a UserBuildConfig file. It is a central place where the user can
# set variables affecting certain aspects of the build, such as debug,
# warnings and optimization settings. The file is ignored by CVS.
#
# The following variables can be set:
# 
# CCFLAGS, C++FLAGS		- Flags passed to the C/C++ compiler.
# DEBUG					- If not empty, will turn on debugging, i.e. will
#						  add respective C/C++ compiler and linker flags and
#						  the CPP DEBUG macro.
# DEFINES				- CPP macros to be defined, e.g. something like
#						  `SPECIAL_FEATURE' or `CACHE_SIZE=1024'.
# HDRS					- List of directories to be added to the local include
#						  search paths.
# LINKFLAGS				- Flags passed to the linker.
# LOCATE_MAIN_TARGET	- Directory where the main targets (i.e. applications,
#						  libraries shall be placed). Should usually not be
#						  tampered with by the user.
# OPTIM					- Optimization specific flags passed to the C/C++
#						  compiler. Usually you want to use OPTIMIZE instead.
# OPTIMIZE				- If not set to `0', will turn on optimization, i.e.
#						  will set the respective C/C++ compiler flags
#						  (i.e. the OPTIM variable).
# STRIP_APPS			- if not set to '0', will cause all generated apps to
#						  be stripped. Default is '0', i.e. no stripping
# SYSHDRS				- List of directories to be added to the system include
#						  search paths.
# WARNINGS				- If not set to `0', will turn on warnings, i.e. will
#						  set the respective C/C++ compiler flags.
